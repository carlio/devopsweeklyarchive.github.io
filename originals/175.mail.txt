DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #175 - 11th May 2014

A pretty packed issue this week=2C mainly due to all the excellent content=
 from the recent Monitorama conference in Portland. As well as lots of mon=
itoring we=E2=80=99ve got the usual mix of tools=2C workflow=2C culture an=
d stories.

A presentation that frames Devops as a banner for the creative disruption=
 going on at the moment around IT. Lots of interesting stuff here=2C I=E2=
=80=99m hoping that I can find a video of this talk.

Cron is one of those easy to use but potentially hard to manage tools. Thi=
s presentation introduces Crontabber=2C a python tool intended to make dep=
endency management=2C testing=2C visualisation and just writing cron jobs=
 easier.

Starting out with a very clear description of the what and the why of cont=
inuous delivery this presentation covers pipeline design focused on testin=
g. Rather than talk about tools it focuses nicely on patterns and principl=
es.

A very nice post about the importance of designing code for maintainabilit=
y=2C specifically paying attention to what diffs of changes look like. The=
 examples are in Chef but the theory is sound for anything that=E2=80=99s=
 declarative.

ifications/


A good topic of conversation when it comes to growing teams and codebases=
 is how to manage change. Pull requests are the default GitHub answer but=
 this post makes some good points about the advantages of tools like Phabr=
icator for different workflows.

A presentation introducing the Metrics 2.0 standardisation effort. Covers=
 the problem (naming things is hard) and lays out the proposed solution an=
d some of the tools already using this

A good reminder that the complexity of combining all of the open source mo=
nitoring tools isn=E2=80=99t practical or likely a good idea for lots of s=
mall teams. A good example of a real world monitoring setup.

A short talk on a nifty use of Serverspec=2C integrating it with Sensu for=
 monitoring. The trick using the sensu socket and creating alerts on the f=
ly is very nice.

nitoring-collide


Lots of monitoring tools and talks are starting to take advantage of all t=
hat maths we learned at school. This talk is a nice primer=2C aimed at ope=
rations teams=2C looking at signal processing and filters.

s-for-ops-with-notes


Lots of the above posts come via the recent Monitorama conference. This ne=
xt post is part observation based on the conference conversation=2C but al=
so a call to arms. Are we building tooling aimed at the problems applicati=
on developers have? And more specifically can we stop making everything a=
 strip chart?

Cluster aware management tools appear to be of interest to lots of people=
 at the moment. This post and presentation describe Skynet. It=E2=80=99s n=
ot open source yet but nicely describes the thinking behind building a sim=
ple tool to do this.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #125 - 26th May 2013

A devops as a concept gets more widespread I'm coming across and increasin=
g number of posts about company structure. These posts might be about look=
ing at existing roles in a new light or talking about whole new ways of wo=
rking. The devops community is certainly not short of ambition it seems.

Last years QCon in San Francisco had a Continuous Delivery track which I w=
as lucky enough to spend some time in. All the videos are now up and this=
 post puts them al in one place. The talks are excellent, as the post says=
 they "get out into public the secret sauce of high performing organizatio=
ns" including Etsy, Google and Facebook.

I've acted as the product owner on a few projects at different times and i=
t's a critical, difficult and alas sometimes missing role within teams. Th=
is post is a great introduction to what being a product owner is all about=
 and introduces it from the perspective of a devops minded organisation.

A video of a talk I gave at the last QCon conference in London, all about=
 challenges to portability between different cloud environments and why do=
ing this for complex systems is still hard.

I'm not sure about the title of this post but the content is spot on. A go=
od description of why a separate Devops team is just another silo and why=
 that's probably a bad idea.

A small free ebook (available in PDF, epub, mobi and on the web) all about=
 the Riak datastore. It's very much focused on the basics but it looks lik=
e a great place to get started with investigating Riak.

A good tale of statsd, netcat and some low level TCP debugging. If you're=
 making use of the statsd management port this is definitely of interest b=
ut for anyone else it's a good tale of investigating a problem and learnin=
g about a tool in the process.

A good walk through of using logstash to ship metrics to graphite. Goes fr=
om first principals starting with stdin and stdout and works through using=
 grok filters and getting information from proc and eventually outputting=
 to graphite.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #358 - 5th November 2017

Fairly heavy on tools and architecture this week=2C with lots of details f=
or anyone learning about building or running various flavours of container=

Free Webinar: How BI & Data Science Gets Results
November 16=2C Online

Statistical/data science models can now run on Hadoop in a much more cost-=
effective manner than a few years ago. This results in fostering the conve=
rgence of traditional BI and Data Science disciplines (machine learning=2C=
 artificial intelligence... etc). Join the discussion with an incredible p=
anel including ODPi=2C 4C Decision=2C ZEPL=2C and Pivotal=2C as we'll shar=
e how this phenomenon is going to impact the Hadoop standard.

Neugram is a new scripting language=2C based heavily on Go=2C but with som=
e useful tricks to cut down on some of the syntax. It also provides a REPL=

Psykube provides a slightly higher-level abstraction that the raw APIs for=
 describing applications running on Kubernetes.

CIM looks like a handy tool for anyone managing AWS CloudFormation templat=
es. Rather than try and provide an abstraction=2C CIM provides a number of=
 helpful user interface tools which make working with templates easier.

Fantastic post about culture. This isn't specific to devops or in my exper=

If you're using Ruby you're hopefully familiar with the recent spate of se=
curity vulnerabilities in various gems. This appears to have sparked lots=

Opsworks is the latest addition to the Amazon Web Services suite. It provi=
des a nicely integrated provisioning environment based on Chef and the EC2=

n in your configuration management code. The supporting blog post explains=
 how and gives a more detailed walk through.

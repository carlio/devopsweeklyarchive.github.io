By now everyone will probably be aware=2C but just in case=2C Bash has a s=
erious vulnerability that probably affects you. This is the best write-up=
 I=E2=80=99ve found which quickly explains how this works and how it could=
 be exploited.

My talk from the recent Puppet Conf (disclaimer: I=E2=80=99m now a Puppet=
 Labs employee)=2C all about high level infrastructure testing. Includes a=
 few experiments writing tests against infrastructure APIs and talks a bit=
 about policy driven development.

A full chapter on infrastructure automation from the Practicing Ruby book=
=2C stepping through the why alongside step-by-step examples of Chef recip=
es.

I=E2=80=99ve made this point before but not so eloquently. If you=E2=80=99=
re writing Puppet=2C Chef or similar DSL based tool then you=E2=80=99re a=
 programmer.

Syslog is great=2C except when the standard isn=E2=80=99t actually adhered=
 to. This next post shows how to deal with this situation using logstash a=
nd grok filters.

At a previous job I a bit of desktop work=2C so this article about applyin=
g modern automation and devops approaches to large scale desktop systems w=
as interesting. Lots of good points and ideas.

A good talk and slide deck which quickly explains the state of networking=
 for docker containers.

It=E2=80=99s difficult to get people to work effectively together if they=
 have never met=2C so for distributed organisations organising an internal=
 conference is a nice idea. This post covers a few gotchas and an experien=
ce report from a recent effort.

The new puppet server was released at Puppet Conf. Puppet server is a drop=
-in replacement for the current puppet master with some pretty big perform=
ance and scalability improvements.

If you=E2=80=99re using Route53 DNS then Roadworker should be of interest.=
 It=E2=80=99s a Ruby based DSL for creating zones and records. Good exampl=
es too.

https://github.com/winebarrel/roadworker


If like me you=E2=80=99re maintaining a number of puppet modules you proba=
bly have an occasional day when you try and remember to update lots of sta=
tic files (Rakefile=2C .travis.yml=2C Gemfile=2C etc.) across all of them.=
 Modulesync looks a nice solution to that issue.

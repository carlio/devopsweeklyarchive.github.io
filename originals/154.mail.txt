Writing tests makes your code more maintainable=2C but testing command lin=
e tools can be tricky and not everyone bothers. This post shows a neat app=
roach for making testing the effects of command line tools easier=2C even=
 when they make both local and remote changes.

RethinkDB is an open-source distributed database built to store JSON docum=
ents at scale. Our software is a complex system that allows execution of c=
ustom code on arbitrary datasets and your job=2C as a reliability engineer=
=2C is to ensure RethinkDB clusters are always fast and stable=2C regardle=
ss of what the user throws at them. Your primary responsibilities will fin=
ding=2C fixing=2C and preventing performance bottlenecks in RethinkDB and=
 building testing automation infrastructure.

Scale Summit is an unconference event=2C bringing together professionals f=
rom the operations and software development communities who have a particu=
lar interest in scalable=2C high performance systems. It=E2=80=99s going t=
o be in London early next year and you can sign up now to find out when mo=
re information is available.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Bosh=2C the release engineering toolkit from CloudFoundry=2C can be used f=
or all sorts of management tasks=2C but it=E2=80=99s not the easiest tool=
 to learn. This project provides a nice example of standing up a Chef mana=
ged stack using Bosh which aims to be easier to follow that standing up an=
 entire CloudFoundry instance.

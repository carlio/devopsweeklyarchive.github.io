=99m wondering what the next 5 years will look like.

A good post on why culture change is difficult=2C especially in a large en=

Having a single place where commands can be run against an infrastructure=

Ever wondered what it=E2=80=99s like attending a Devopsdays event? Well th=

=2C we definitely should have done something similar in London.

A nice observation about the differences in API design between a local API=
=2C where many calls are fine=2C and something crossing a network boundary=

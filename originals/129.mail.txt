One area of development that's often been quite separate from the devops m=
ovement is front-end engineerings. This post proposes that increasingly th=
ere is lots of work for a front-end operations engineer around build proce=
sses, performance, measurement and automation.

I mentioned the new Etsy anomaly detection stack Kale, Skyline and Oculus=
 last issue. Here's the presentation which introduced it at Velocity. Lots=
 of details about how it works under the hood and the performance challeng=
es of all those metrics.

Packaging software for inclusion in operating systems is often a thankless=
 task, but this post does make some good points about the benefits of more=
 monolithic packages including dependencies over the desire to split every=
thing up.

If monolithic packages are of interest one way of building them is using t=
he Omnibus tool from Opscope, which I've mentioned before. Here's a nice t=
utorial on how to use it.

andalone-ruby-gem

d this next link is an interesting recorded discussion about devops in dis=
tributed teams. Lots of practical tips and challenges.

A good writeup of the general pattern of immutable servers, launching new=
 instances when changes are required rather than upgrading existing machin=
es. A name might make discussing this idea easier too.

A nice and simple introduction to using Nginx aimed mainly at developers.=
 Nginx configuration is amazingly powerful, and easy to pick up once you u=
nderstand the basics.

Testing against non-production environments with real traffic can be trick=
y. Gor is a new tool that collects and then can replay traffic in real-tim=

Maintaining a large number of Jenkins jobs using the web based interface c=

If you already have a set of configured servers moving to using configurat=
ion management tools like Puppet can seem a lot of work. Pysa is a new too=
l that aims to generate Puppet code based on the existing configuration of=
 a running server. Maybe a good way of seeing value quickly.

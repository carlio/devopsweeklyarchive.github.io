News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Lots of readers of this newsletter will hopefully be having a well earned=
 rest this weekend after the announcement on Monday of a serious bug in Op=
enSSL that has incredibly widespread implications. The bug=2C named Heartb=
leed=2C affects everyone. If you=E2=80=99re not already on top of this her=
e=E2=80=99s a few useful posts.

A great presentation deck about what continuous delivery means to the peop=
le involved. Focuses on the difficulty of changing medium sized teams and=
 what happens to the developer=2C tester and systems administrator roles.

A solid argument that release testing=2C as a separate activity at least=
=2C is a bad idea when looking to take advantage of continuous delivery. L=
ots of good references too if you=E2=80=99re making this case at work.

CoreOS is starting to get very interesting=2C with the addition of higher=
 levels tools like fleet which give you an idea about the ambition of the=
 project. This presentation does a good job of introducing some of the new=
 functionality.

A good run through of some of the disadvantages or at least challenges whe=
n building out a system based on many small service. The demand for=2C and=
 interest in=2C operations experience definitely feels like it goes hand-i=
n-hand with this pattern.

elocity and LISA.

What is high availability and how do you achieve it? This is always fiddly=
 in my experience=2C at least for software that=E2=80=99s not distributed=
 by default. This presentation from the recent LOADays conference has some=
 good examples.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

I=E2=80=99ve often used software testing tools for monitoring purposes=2C=
 but one of the challenges is extracting the relevant information from a t=
est run. This post and set of tools does a nice job of that for Python=2C=
 as well as providing a good dashboard for raising the visibility of test=
 runs.

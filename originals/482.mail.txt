With a surge of developers and IT practitioners working remotely=2C there=
=E2=80=99s also a surge of confusion and operational inefficiency. See how=
 data and automation is improving the way DevOps and IT operations enginee=

Analysis of a recent paper on analyzing characteristics of serverless usag=
e=2C looking at the interesting optimisation where users want fast functio=
n start times and the cloud provider wants to minimise resources consumed.

A post on the importance of egress filtering of network traffic. ALthough=
 this particular post talks about Serverless=2C this is relevant to any ar=
chitecture or infrastructure I think.

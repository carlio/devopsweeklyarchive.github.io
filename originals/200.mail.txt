Quite meta this one. It=E2=80=99s an ignite talk I gave at Devopsdays all=

igures for the long time reader.

Probably my favourite ignite talk from Devopsdays=2C seeing if you can spo=
t real statements made about devops from those generated using a Markov ch=
ain text generator.

If you=E2=80=99re just getting to grips with monitoring it can be difficul=
t to know where to start. This presentation gives you a quick overview of=
 the last 5 years. Lots of ideas for things to improve.

Another entertaining ignite talk=2C entitled Devops is the Macguffin. As a=
 community we sometimes disagree on the meaning of the term Devops=2C but=
 how much does that matter if we improve at what we=E2=80=99re doing? I co=
uldn=E2=80=99t agree more.

Another of the culture focused talks=2C this one focused on understanding=
 empathy from a scientific perspective.

An interesting discussion about the use of digital signatures (specificall=

y management even harder.

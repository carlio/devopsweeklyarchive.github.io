runv is analogous to the runc container runtime=2C except runv runs your c=
ontainer on top of a real hypervisor. Currently supports kvm=2C xen and vi=
rtualbox. Useful if you need additional isolation guarantees.

Funker is an interesting experimental approach to packaging up pieces of y=
our application (functions or otherwise) as Docker containers and have the=
m run on-demand on a swarm.

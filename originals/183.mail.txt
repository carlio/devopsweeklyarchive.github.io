DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #183 - 6th July 2014

Two of the featured tools this week (Puppet Explorer and Tesera) reminded=
 me just how far we=E2=80=99ve come in only a few years with really nice l=
ooking user interfaces for operations tools. The long running thread on th=
e Jenkins mailing list about user interfaces improvements also suggests we=
=E2=80=99re starting to demand tools that prioritise design and user exper=
ience as well as functionality.

Puppet=2C like most tools=2C is it=E2=80=99s own reference implementation=
=2C which makes certain kinds of interoperability or tooling difficult to=
 maintain. So this attempt to formalise the puppet language via a specific=
ation is interesting for a number of reasons.

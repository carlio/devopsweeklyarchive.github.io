DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #163 - 16th February 2014

As an example of just how far the whole devops movement has come you need=
 to look no further than the two job posts we have this week. One is for a=
 US based startup you may have heard of=2C Chef. The other is for a UK bas=
ed school taking a pretty innovative approach to internal IT.

Really good introduction to lots of devops practices from a Microsoft view=
 point. Includes some examples of pretty neat IDE integration=2C Visual St=
udio Online features and integration with open source tools like Chef=2C P=
uppet and Jenkins. Even if you=E2=80=99re not a Microsoft shop you should=
 have a look at this.

Everyone is still using Nagios=2C or so this talk claims=2C and we need to=
 move to other tools in order to advance the state of monitoring. A well a=
rgued presentation with lots of good examples of why Nagios is still popul=
ar=2C why it shouldn=E2=80=99t be and what we can do about it.

Another follow up to a post I included a few weeks back on devops practice=
s in traditional enterprise environments. Lots of good counter arguments h=
ere about misunderstandings and more interestingly about the difficulty of=
 changing culture.

-is-wrong/


More and more I=E2=80=99m seeing people really embrace the code part of in=
frastructure as code. To me it=E2=80=99s always been about adopting progra=
mming techniques. Here=E2=80=99s a good example=2C showing how to use stub=
s and test doubles when testing Chef cookbooks with ChefSpec

cation router=2C and in particular demoing some nice integration with Pupp=
et via some new puppet types.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Aptly is a powerful Apt repository management tool. It makes mirroring rep=
ositories=2C as well as keeping them up-to-date or backporting packages tr=
ivial. Lots of documentation with lots of other interesting use-cases as w=
ell.

Testing applications under slow or flaky network conditions can be difficu=
lt and time consuming. Blockade aims to make that easier. A config file de=
fines a number of docker containers and a command line tool makes introduc=
ing controlled network problems simple. Very interesting.

If you=E2=80=99re like me you spend quite a lot of time interacting with G=
it. Well Gitsh aims to make that interaction easier=2C providing a dedicat=
ed shell for working with the version control system. Shorter commands=2C=
 autocompletion=2C color based feedback and some clever defaults make this=
 worth a look.

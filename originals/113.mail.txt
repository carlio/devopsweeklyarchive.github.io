DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #113 - 3rd March 2013

Conference season appears to have started in earnest again, which makes fi=
nding good content that little bit easier. Quite a few presentations this=
 week, and with lots more events coming up (see the excellent list compile=
d by the folks from Melbourne in this issue) we can hopefully expect many=
 more. If you see any good presentations be sure to let me know.

Presentation from the recent Scale conference all about logstash from the=

gs an dgood tooling.

Interesting article from Yahoo about how they are working on the processin=
g of large datasets, and how in many cases mapreduce/hadoop/batch processi=
ng don't cut it. Some interesting dicussion of using Strom for stream proc=
essing alongside data in HDFS/HBase.

Good post from Forrester about the problems with some private cloud roll-o=
uts in large organisations. The points about putting users first make me h=
appy.

Logging is important, but can involve more moving parts than it first appe=
ars. This post covers quite a specific question, but the answer includes a=
 wide range of handy information about file handles, pipes, log rotation a=
nd more. Worth reading.

A presentation from last year all about infrastructure in startups, or rea=
lly about any infrastructure in young projects in any organisation.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Buildpacks are a fantastic way of extending Heroku (and soon Cloudfoundry)=
=2E This one gives you your own personal ruby gems server, which might be of=
 interest if you have private gems or you like that little bit of control.

Deliver looks an interesting (and very colourful) deployment tool based pu=
rely around Git and bash. Not needing Ruby or Python or another programmin=
g language appears to be it's main selling point but it's simplicity might=
 be great for smaller projects or teams using different technologies.

mcollective is incredibly powerful, but the different moving parts can mak=
e trying it out tricky. This vagrant based demo is therefore hugely welcom=
e. By default it fires up a 6 node cluster, all configured to use mcollect=
ive and a range of plugins. The README then takes you through the differen=
t capabilities.

 the devops conversation is reaching.

The ideas behind bi-modal IT were hot topics at the recent Devopsdays Lond=
on event=2C with some strong opinions that the model leads to all sorts of=
 problems=2C including formalising silos. This talk summed up some of the=
 issues.

A useful review of the recent SRE book. The review does focus on some nega=
tive issues=2C which I think are important to discuss. A useful reminder o=
f the importance of shared language=2C and silos that can emerge without i=
t.

If you=E2=80=99re using public cloud then making use of autoscaling groups=

 how.

Interesting post on making real-time scaling decisions based on constant f=
eedback from the running system. Useful comparison to other approaches=2C=
 including simply using queues for transport.

A great deal of the infrastructure software we use and rely on is open sou=
rce=2C so I think it=E2=80=99s useful and important to discuss the models=
 under which contributions are licensed. This post is a discussion around=
 CLAs vs the newer Developer Certificate of Origin.

ibutor-license-agreements/


Another reason for being skeptical about the curl pipe bash approach to so=
ftware installation. It=E2=80=99s possible to detect on the server side=2C=
 and hence to serve different content.

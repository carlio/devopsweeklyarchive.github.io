ISSUE #415 - 9th December 2018

Just arriving in Seattle with 8000 others for KubeCon and CloudNativeCon.=
 The only problem is likely to be keeping up with all the context and anno=
uncements. If you don=E2=80=99t like Kubernetes you might want to skip nex=
t week=E2=80=99s issue.

News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Something I=E2=80=99ve been working on recently=2C along with folks from M=
icrosoft and other tech companies. Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB)=
 is a specification for a general packaging format for multi-service (and=
 multi-toolchain) applications.

https://cnab.io/


The CNAB spec is pretty low-level. Conversely Docker App is a high-level u=
ser-facing tool for parameterising and sharing Compose based applications=
=2C including for Kubernetes. It implements the CNAB spec under the hood=
=2C which opens up signing and all-in-one bundles and compatibility with o=
ther supporting tools.

A nice write-up of solving a scaling problem by distributing work across m=
ultiple machines=2C looking at features flags to roll out and a service di=
scovery and locking mechanism to ensure certain characteristics.

scaling-our-cloudwatch-integration/


It=E2=80=99s one thing to setup a CI system=2C but how do you get developm=
ent teams to adopt it? This post looks at providing a higher-level DSL whi=
ch makes reuse across teams using similar technologies much easier.

A set of slides on the evolution of devops. Some reading between the lines=
 required but lots of great reading recommendations and a reminder that de=
vopsdays (and devops in general) is an amazing story of people sharing and=
 helping others.

Crossplane is an open source multicloud control plane. It introduces workl=
oad and resource abstractions on-top of existing managed services that ena=
bles a high degree of workload portability across cloud providers. It prov=
ides primitives for Azure=2C AWS and GCP out of the box and an API based o=
n Kubernetes.

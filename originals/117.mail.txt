DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #117 - 31st March 2013

Monitorama in Boston was amazing. Huge thanks to Jason Dixon and everyone=
 else involved who organised, attended or sponsored the event. If you're n=
ot interested in monitoring I'd probably recommend skipping this entire is=
sue, if not the links, presentations and new tools should keep you buys. E=
ven the jobs are with folks who were at monitorama. See everyone in Berlin=

A talk in the style of an essay, this one on Monitoring for humans. A good=
 account of the status quo, lot of improvements to the technology and tool=
s, but not as much discussion of what makes a good check or what makes a w=
orthwhile alert.

An entertaining run through the state of monitoring, focusing on a few are=

 and more.

A follow up to a previous article, about problems that occur if you take a=

MIT Lincoln Laboratory is currently looking for a student enrolled in coll=
ege to do a paid internship/co-op in our Advanced Technologies division. T=
his is a great opportunity to get your feet wet in a role that encourages=
 creative approaches to operations work. You should already be pretty comf=
ortable with Linux environments for this internship, and be familiar with=
 the configuration management platforms such as Puppet. Knowing a language=
 (like PERL, Ruby, Python, PHP) is also useful, as we've got a variety of=
 user-facing and internal tools that could use some improvement. Unfortuna=
tely, due to the nature of Lincoln's work, this internship requires US Cit=
izenship.

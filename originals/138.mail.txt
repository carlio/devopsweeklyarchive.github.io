Not all of the talks at PuppetConf focused on Puppet. This talk covered wh=

A good piece on the trade offs of different software release strategies=2C=

=2C ZMap is capable of performing a complete scan of the IPv4 address spac=

Chocolatey is a package format and manager much like apt=2C but for Window=

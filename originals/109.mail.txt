DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #109 - 3rd February 2013

This issue is coming live from FOSDEM in Brussels, which makes gathering i=
nteresting content from the past week quite easy. The sheer number of talk=
s and new open source tools being discussed or released means I'm bound to=
 have missed something though. Special mention to the folks behind both th=
e Configuration Management and the Testing and Automation rooms yesterday=
 for lots of good content.

FOSDEM
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

One of the talks from the Configuration Management room delved into how we=
 learn to automate. Taking examples from training materials and community=
 efforts and summing up with some support projects can provide to help peo=
ple adopt them.

Another talk from the Configuration Management room, this one focusing on=
 integration testing for Infrastructure. It introduces the new Test Kitche=
n framework, which aims to be a tool agnostic way of building repeatable t=
ests for infrastructure and configuration management code. Lots of good id=
eas in here that should probably exist.

ructure-with-ruby-frameworks


This talk was from the Testing and Automation dev room. It covers building=
 a continuous integration pipeline for building system packages and introd=
uces a number of small tools that can be composed together for the intende=
d purpose. The Gist contains notes and links to all the tools mentioned.

A great, long and detailed writeup of why the recent Ruby on Rails vulnera=
bilities matter to you whether you're a Ruby/Rails shop or not. Lots of go=
od, scary examples and lots of advice, especially if you're not up on secu=
rity exploits.

Good talk on GitHub culture. The main take away surrounds how company stru=
cture is strongly linked with the prevailing culture of the organisation.

Puppetcamp Ghent happened just before FOSDEM and this talk quickly demonst=
rates how to manage puppet with mcollective. Enabling and disabling runs,=

 good short introduction to using mcollective.

It's a good week for epic blog posts. This one is a fantastic case study a=
ll about introducing a devops culture into a traditional enterprise. Lots=
 to admire and lots more to learn from, whether you work in an enterprise=
 environment or not.

Extending Nginx using Lua appears to be incredibly powerful, and real worl=
d tutorials like this one make a good case for investigating it for certai=
n use cases.

Tools

I ended up speaking to the author of OWASP Zed Attack Proxy on Friday at F=
OSDEM. It looks to be a great penetration and vulnerability testing tool,=
 and one that lends itself to being used as part of a continuous integrati=
on setup. Version 2.0.0 has just been released.

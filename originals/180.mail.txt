An interview with the creator of Docker=2C talking about libswarm and the=

A good example of the integration required to fit code review into a deplo=
yment pipeline. This example uses Gerrit=2C along with Jenkins and Amazon=

If you=E2=80=99re familiar with the acronym COTS (for Commercial Off-the-S=

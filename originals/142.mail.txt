Monitorama
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This monitorama talk discussed the use of algorithms in monitoring and ano=
maly detection=2C and points out why some of our statistical tools are all=
 that useful given the data we collect.

I had the good fortune to speak at Monitorama this time around=2C about in=
tegrating various security and penetration testing tools with a modern ope=
n source monitoring system.

Once you have lots of metrics you probably want to alert on certain states=
=2E This next presentation covered the psychology of alert design with examp=
les from other types of alert systems.

One of the general themes of the conference was using monitoring tools for=
 much more than measuring low level system metrics. This talk discusses al=
l sorts of business information that is useful to measure and what tools (=
if any) are used for that now.

Elasticsearch got lots of love at Monitorama with a bunch of talks and wor=
kshops discussing it. This talk focused on it=E2=80=99s use for storing lo=
gs=2C looking at a number of tools for getting information in and out and=
 some common configuration issues.

A talk about some of the limitations of common monitoring approaches=2C an=
d some examples of a new clojure based toolset that aims to fix some of th=
em. Includes a nice conceptual model of a modern monitoring setup.

News

Omnibus is a tool for building monolithic system packages=2C where you inc=
lude everything including any dependencies. It=E2=80=99s a great way of di=
stributing software with complex dependencies in a simple way. This presen=
tation explains why and how.

A good post about why=2C as an infrastructure engineer=2C you might also b=
e well suited to running your own company or service given the high demand=
 for infrastructure skills at the moment.

An interesting discussion of why high availability isn=E2=80=99t always wo=
rth the cost and additional complexity=2C and why many of the solutions to=
 availability are centred around people and processes not technology.

ity-is-overrated/


A good introduction to getting started with Test Kitchen=2C an integration=
 testing tool ideal for testing configuration management code across multi=
ple local virtual machines.

http://blog.nistu.de/2013/09/21/getting-started-with-test-kitchen


A claim that releasing software (in this case Python packages=2C but it=E2=
=80=99s a general point) is normal too hard. Shows examples of the OpenSta=
ck toolchain which simplifies this=2C and lots of good comments with tools=
 that can help.

Events

Cassandra Summit Europe is an event covering training and presentations on=
 the NoSQL database Cassandra. Held on 16th and 17th October in London=2C=
 the conference will include presentations from Hailo=2C NetFlix and Spoti=
fy on their use of Cassandra=2C as well as sessions on the recent launch o=
f Cassandra 2.0 by apache Cassandra chair Jonathan Ellis. The first 15 peo=

Config Management Camp is going to be held on the 3rd and 4th of February=
 next year in Gent=2C Belgium. Expect discussion and participation from Ch=
ef=2C Puppet=2C Ansible=2C Salt=2C CFEngine and more. It is cunningly just=
 after FOSDEM too so why not extend your stay for a few days?

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

I=E2=80=99m seeing lots of interest in simple roll-your-own Platform as a=
 Service tools at the moment. AWSBox uses EC2 to make creating a node.js s=
pecific PaaS simple=2C based on some of the open source nodejitsu tools.

https://github.com/mozilla/awsbox


Another interesting tool in the roll-your-own PaaS space is OSv. It basica=
lly does away with the operating system layer=2C running a JVM directly on=
 top of the underlying hypervisor. Currently supports Xen=2C KVM and EC2.

Mentioned in one of the Monitorama talks=2C es-utils provides a bunch of h=
andy utility scripts for managing an elasticsearch cluster.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The problem of building Docker containers is definitely ripe for new tools=

yntax=2C makes smarter decisions about the creation of layers and aims to=
 be faster than the standard docker build command.

ng all machines directly. SSHmuxd is an application which aims to make thi=
s easier to manage=2C at the same time as introducing some basic access co=
ntrol features.

 language to write tests for Puppet by adding a new assertion type to the=
 language.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #140 - 8th September 2013

The broad range of things under the Devops banner is becoming more and mor=
e apparent to me as I read everything from articles in Wired to white pape=
rs from enterprise consultancy firms to code on GitHub. The fact a genuine=
 community still exists around things like Devops Days and small personal=
 blogs is pretty impressive if you ask me. Thanks to everyone who makes th=
at happen.

Devops is increasingly being mentioned in notable places away from it=E2=
=80=99s humble beginnings. Here=E2=80=99s a good article in Wired no-less.=
 Useful for those cases where someone suggests you=E2=80=99re just making=
 all of this stuff up.

A nice overview of tools and dashboards that the team at Stack Exchange ha=
ve developed. Of particular interest is that many of these are build for r=
unning and managing Windows environments.

A good argument that for Devops approaches to succeed across large organis=
ations we need to adjust how we consider certain aspects=2C in light of lo=
oking at the difference between utility and value added services.

ops-for-mature-it/


Good write-up of instrumenting a new application using StatsD and Graphite=
=2E Examples of dashboards=2C and how they changed over time=2C as well as s=
ome more specific python and django hints and tips.

With all the interest around building tools on top of Docker at the moment=
 a new repository has been created to try and list all of them in once pla=
ce. If you=E2=80=99re interested in Docker then take a look at the Dockerf=
orge.

A good critique of the recent Facebook paper about how they deliver softwa=
re to production. It=E2=80=99s opinionated in a few places but does a good=
 job of highlighting some of the main areas of interest.

Sovereign is an integrated set of components for building your own self-ho=
sted replacement for popular cloud services. So email=2C calendars=2C file=
 storage=2C text hosting=2C vpn=2C irc=2C etc. It=E2=80=99s also a nice ex=
ample of using Ansible which might be a good way of learning the tool.

Sparkey is a simple constant key/value storage library=2C for read-heavy s=
ystems with infrequent large bulk inserts. It=E2=80=99s basically a very f=
ast low overhead disk-backed hashtable and has been developed at Spotify f=
or some interesting usecases.

https://github.com/spotify/sparkey


Travis has become a really useful part of the open source ecosystem=2C but=
 if you have a powerful local machine anyway it can be useful to run a ful=
l matrix build locally before pushing your code. Enter wwtd=2C or what wou=
ld travis do.

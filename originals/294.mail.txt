g infrastructure.

Demonstrating hello-world examples for tools aimed at complex distributed=
 systems can be tricky. Ideally you=E2=80=99d have a realistic demo exampl=
e composed of several services - enter sock shop.

With so many of the tools we use being command line based=2C any discussio=
n of improving the user experience of CLI tools is a good thing in my book=
=2E Some interesting ideas here about a formal grammar and about onboarding=
 new users.

A look at the medium/long term impact of containers and orchestrators on t=

How adopting a platform changes individual roles within an organisation is=

ok at one approach=2C focusing on a platform and separate application team=
 model.

An interesting approach to profiling any arbitrary code=2C using the new s=
ysdig tracer functionality. If you could print to /dev/null you get a powe=
rful tool for profiling and visualising traces.

Moving from statically addressable systems to scheduled containers poses s=
ome questions about service discovery. Here=E2=80=99s a simple discussion=
 of the problem and a solution for erlang processes on Kubernetes.

A good example of using Prometheus to monitor containers=2C in this case t=
hose making up Kubernetes. Examples of queries and of the resulting graphs=
 and dashboards.

A discussion of the role of automation in testing=2C and in particular why=
 building tools to augment and ease testing by people=2C rather than to re=
place it=2C might be the right approach.

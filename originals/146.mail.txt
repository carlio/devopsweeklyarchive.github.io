Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

 hugely useful. PKGR combines Heroku buildpacks and system packages to pro=
vide a very nice interface for building system packages of your applicatio=
ns.

Ansible has a number of modules built-in which allow you to use it for man=
aging virtual machines from various cloud providers. This project demonstr=
ates a simple integration with Digital Ocean=2C creating an entire infrast=
ructure from a simple YAML file.

DNSYO is a little tool built to help keep track of DNS propagation. In sho=
rt=2C it's nslookup=2C if nslookup queried over 1500 servers and collated=
 their results.

Megaphone looks like an interesting little monitoring tool. It=E2=80=99s d=
esigned to be run locally on all your machines=2C and provides a HTTP and=
 JSON based interface to checks=2C which should make integration with othe=
r tools easy.

I have a talk just yesterday on the intersection of configuration manageme=
nt and service discovery=2C and why you need two speeds of configuration.=
 The examples use Puppet and Consul=2C but the ideas should apply more gen=
erally.

Containers=2C and the accompanying ecosystem of tools are often finding a=
 first use in testing pipelines. This example covers using CoreOS and Dock=
er alongside Jenkins for simpe cross-platform testing.

Last week I mentioned Chef Conf and I=E2=80=99ve found a few good writeups=
 of the conference in general and a number of the talks. Lots of links fro=

Recruitment and recruiters often get a bad press=2C so this blog post all=

cruiters.

A nice walkthrough of creating a continuous deployment pipeline using Meso=

ter with a pair of load balancers to service application traffic.

Audit mode is one of the interesting new additions to Chef=2C allowing you=

roduction and has a bunch of easy-to-follow examples.

An interesting way of seeing the inner workings of an open source project=

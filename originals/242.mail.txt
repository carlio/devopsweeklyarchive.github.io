I always like finding well written postmortems of incidents and this write=
 up of some observations from reading several postmortems is excellent. Se=
veral common themes emerge.

I don=E2=80=99t generally cover point releases of tools due to the sheer v=
olume but rkt 0.8 is worth a mention due to the new runtime which takes ad=
vantage of hardware virtualisation to better isolate containers from the h=
ost and each other.

Some nice points about the advantages of using a single monolithic source=
 code repository (as used by Google=2C Facebook=2C Twitter and others) rat=
her than the one repository per project model which is probably more commo=
n.

A nice presentation on the increasing interest in single purpose computing=
 for server applications=2C nicely tying this to containers and potentiall=

One of the practices that has emerged along with devops is writing tests f=
or your infrastructure. Although common in professional software developme=
nt writing automated tests might still be something you need to sell insid=
e your organisation=2C this post is a good starting point.

A nice list of resources for systems administrators=2C mainly a list of to=
ols categorised into everything from virtualisation to editors=2C but also=
 includes a few book recommendations

Bosh=2C often used alongside Cloud Foundry=2C is super powerful but also q=
uite a departure from similar tools and takes a bit of understanding. This=
 simple tutorial is a nice place to start.

A personal option on why ITIL and ITSM practices fail. Somewhat one sided=
 but some good observations in there=2C and the comments continue the disc=
ussion.

A nice war story to accompany the above post on some of the potential fail=
ings of ITIL implementations. Optimising for change is definitely a part o=
f adopting devops practices that=E2=80=99s often taken for granted in smal=
l organisations and probably the most important part in larger ones.

One of the strengths of Mesos is that you can bring your own framework if=
 the existing ones (like Chronos or Marathon) don=E2=80=99t fit your useca=
se. Fenzo is a new scheduler from Netflix and the post explains why writin=
g a new framework made sense.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #170 - 6th April 2014

Definitely the first issue of devops weekly where the first three news ite=
ms are Windows related. At the recent Build conference it looks like Micro=
soft is making a genuine attempt to catch up with the last few years of In=
frastructure as code - and in particular integrating with existing popular=
 tools like Chef=2C Puppet=2C Vagrant and Chocolatey. This can only be a g=
ood thing in my view.

News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Microsoft have released Windows Management Framework V5 preview=2C with th=
e oddly named OneGet. This is a simple package manager for PowerShell whic=
h can install packages from the community Chocolatey repository. Intriguin=
gly =E2=80=9CSupport of additional repositories will come in subsequent ve=
rsions=E2=80=9D.

ment-framework-v5-preview.aspx


Microsoft have also released an official Windows vagrant box=2C of  Window=
s Server 2012 R2 Datacenter. This appears to be a trial=2C with the downlo=
ad available for 90 days and the box working for 180 days.

More news for Windows users. At the recent Build conference both Puppetlab=
s and Chef announced much improved Windows and Azure support. Combined wit=
h the above Vagrant box it feels like Windows might be starting to catch u=
p on the automation front.

My talk at Puppetcamp London this week=2C all about test driven developmen=
t with Puppet. It=E2=80=99s mainly aimed at being an introduction to softw=
are testing=2C test driven development and then to the tools available for=
 Puppet - including the new Beaker acceptance testing framework.

Another of the talks from Puppetcamp London=2C this one all about building=
=2C testing and using AMI images on EC2. Lots of practical tips from using=
 Jenkins pipelines to =E2=80=98immutable=E2=80=99 servers.

The service management framework ITIL has many fans=2C and this is a reall=
y nice writeup of how it may change based on devops experiences

A post all about why Vagrant is such an important tool when adopting a dev=
ops mentality. By having a tool that everyone uses you can cut across silo=
s and ultimately build empathy.

A good set of recommendations around branching strategies=2C including fea=
ture branching in code rather than using your source control system. Lots=
 of folks still resist doing everything in master.

A good post comparing a deployment specific tool (in this case Octopus) wi=
th a configuration management tool for deployment. Some good observations=
 about similarities and differences. The comments also add to the debate a=
bout whether one or two tools is best.

Nginx is one of my favourite bits of software=2C but historically you=E2=
=80=99ve had to spend at least some time learning the basics from a variet=
y of different source. The new official admin guide is therefore pretty ha=
ndy for those that haven=E2=80=99t used Nginx yet.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #110 - 10th February 2013

Logstash, one of the tools I've featured quite a few times in this newslet=
ter has a book available, and a self published one at that. I'd love to se=
e more self publishing around emerging tools and topics from the devops co=
mmunity. Traditional publishing is hard in such a fast moving environment,=
 but being able to read a book rather than a blog post can really help wit=
h understanding a new tool or topic.

The logstash book has been released! I read this coming back from FOSDEM a=
nd it's well worth spending some time with. It covers why log management i=
s important, how to get started with logstash and just as interestingly ho=
w to scale up and how to make decisions about the different logstash compo=
nents.

Platform as a Service architectures are interesting (at least to me), and=
 this post, the first in a series, starts to dissect the inner workings of=
 CloudFoudry. This post covers how the application is run with lots of cod=
e examples and by running one of the CloudFoundry components on it's own.

Goo list of handy one-liners for knife, the chef command line tool. A mix=
 of search tips and exec hacks, if you understand all of these you'll prob=
ably be able to adapt them for lots of other uses too.

An old post (from 2009) but worth reading amongst the recent spate of vuln=
erabilities. This covers timing attacks, and is probably the clearest (and=
 scariest) description I've read of what's quite an interesting attack vec=
tor for certain systems.

Even the skeptics are coming round to the Devops ideas it seems. Good post=
 on how ITIL and other more traditional approaches can be seen in terms of=
 Devops. Looking forward to more details.

Interesting presentation from the recent Monkigras conference, on what the=
 big data and data science community can learn from the devops movement. T=
he phrase "analysis as code" should hopefully stick in the same way as inf=
rastructure as code has done.

Another survey, this one focusing on operations productivity. It's 25 ques=
tions and the plan is to release the resultings in a month or so.

Some good tips on network tuning, nginx configuration and debugging perfor=
mance issues around a simple but high throughput node.js application. Most=
 of it should be relevant for anyone proxying to evented applications.

Jobs

Red Gate Software are looking for a DevOps Engineer to join their team. In=
 the next year, Red Gate's infrastructure will undergo more change than in=
 the previous five. They're committed to the cloud, to the blurring of the=
 line between developer and sysadmin, to automation and the move towards i=
nfrastructure as code, and to monitoring as the foundation of responsive i=
nfrastructure. If you're some peripatetic hybrid of developer and sysadmin=
, imbued with a depth of understanding of how this cool stuff can work for=
 a mature company, then go and help them build it. Simply upload your CV a=
nd cover letter to apply.

Tools

Interesting plugin for Vagrant. This uses the ZFS filesystem to make snaps=
hots of virtual machines, and claims to drastically improve the first boot=
 time.

Monigusto is an integrated suite of monitoring tools, packaged as a series=
 of Chef recipes and a vagrant configuration. It looks a great starting po=
int if you want to experiment with a pre-configured monitoring stack.

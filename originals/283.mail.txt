DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #283 - 29th May 2016

Serverlessconf kicked off a bunch of interesting conversations on the inte=
rnet this week about the serverless architectural style. I just wanted to=
 say thanks to the many folks who contributed to that discussion with a fo=
cus on what it means for operations. Lets try and avoid the hyperbole and=
 slipping into well-trodden silos.

like=2C approach to building Docker images.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #114 - 10th March 2013

Fewer tools but an awful lot to read this week, including a few short book=
s available for free online. If you skip everything else or just skim the=
 outlines I'd definitely read the first article in full. Then read it agai=
n and think about how it applies to our domain of fast moving technology,=
 and more importantly how we avoid the need for too much devops archaeolog=
y in the future.

This first article doesn't appear to have anything to do with devops. It's=
 about institutional memory, engineering archaeology, documentation and do=
cument management. It's about a chemical engineering plant. But I bet most=
 people can read this and see it either in their past or future when it co=
mes to the computer system we build.

A Platform as a Service is generally made up of quite a few interesting mo=
ving parts. This free book (available online or to download) covers some o=
f the dotcloud details, but much of the software discussed is open source.=
 Some good low level resource management and file system stuff.

Nice write-up of continuous deployment from an individual developers persp=
ective. I particularly liked the like "The real secret to the success of c=

Anyone running real life systems will get reports of errors from users or=
 the code itself at some point, and not all error reports are useful (to p=
ut it politely). This post covers a manifesto for error reporting, with se=
veral good tips worth considering next time you write error handling code.

Chef 11 has some awesome new features, but unless you've been following al=

Understanding the potential security risks of browser based applications c=
an be quite a challenge, their are quite a few odd attack vectors and thin=
gs people place too much trust in (third party javascript anyone?). This e=
xcellent on-line book has a wealth of information about all things browser=
 and security. Well worth a read. I just wish I could find a good ebook ve=
rsion.

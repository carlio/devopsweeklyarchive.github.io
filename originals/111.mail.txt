DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #111 - 17th February 2013

This community grew partly out of the first devopsdays event in Ghent. Loo=
king at http://devopsdays.org/ now you'll see 14 events this year organise=
d already, from Europe and the US all the way to Brazil, India, Tokyo and=
 New Zealand. That's pretty impressive. Thanks to all the people involved=
 in organising those events, hopefully their is a good cross over between=
 attendees and readers of this newsletter.

Ever wanted to use the Vagrant workflow with something other than VirtualB=
ox? Work has been ongoing to support multiple providers for a while, and c=
ode and demos can be found with Vagrant working with VMWare Fusion. But th=
is post, a demo of the upcoming 1.1 release, shows Vagrant working with EC=
2. Ideal for those times when your local machine can't run all those virtu=
al machines.

An article explaining why devops is needed, and predicting big inroads in=
 traditional enterprises in 2013. The $440 million loss made by Knight Cap=
ital because of using the incorrect version of network softare might just=
 be the best example of why good configuration management matters.

Good reminder that rapid application development needs to consider it's ap=
proach to security, because doing it after the fact is probably too late.=
 I particularly liked the point that with iterative development and modern=
 technology "you risk generating a considerable amount of insecure code ve=
ry quickly".

Chef is pretty flexible about how you accomplish your goals, which does me=
an it's possible to do things in ways that might come back to bite you lat=
er. This post covers a few of those anti-patterns, including forking commu=
nity cookbooks and misuse of roles.

Kafka, the distributed publish/subscribe middleware is getting a Intra-clu=

s.

Another good read on distributed systems, this post covers a wealth of pra=

Fatcache says it's memcached for SSDs. Memcached stores things in memory,=
 which is great up until you have a huge amount of data and can't afford t=
he RAM. Fatcache uses a similar approach but stores things on SSDs.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #253 - 8th November 2015

A small but hopefully well formed issue this week with content ranging fro=
m the latest technology (unikernels=2C pester) to avoiding single points o=
f failure in people. Also a reminder that you should definitely try and ma=
ke Configuration Management Camp next year if you=E2=80=99re in Europe in=
 February.

Excellent looking talk focusing on how single points of failure often emer=
ge from the people administering a system more than the underlying infrast=
ructure.

I=E2=80=99ve featured several unikernel articles over the last year=2C but=
 deploying them can still require some work. This post describes how to ge=
t OSV up and running on Google Cloud Platform.

A good example of using testing tools to verify production infrastructure.=
 In this post the author uses the Pester testing framework for Powershell=
 to verify DNS configuration.

A nice introduction to the chatops concept. I particularly like all the ex=
amples - from deploying applications and building infrastructure to ideas=
 for sales/marketing and support.

It=E2=80=99s easier to track buzz than actual adoption for software=2C so=
 the data about actual Docker adoption in this roundup is interesting. Sev=
eral facts and figures (from a specific sample) about container lifetime=
=2C containers per host=2C adoption rates and more.

A good rightup of failures which exhibit irreversible and cascading proper=
ties=2C specifically looking at the recent dynamodb outage and nicely brea=
king down the official postmortem.

An interesting deck which makes the point testing is bad for catching unkn=
own unknowns=2C and that extending testing with production monitoring is o=
ne approach to this problem.

Configuration Management Camp is back on the 1st and 2nd of February in Ge=

Tools

Inspec is a new infrastructure testing tool based on the rspec Ruby testin=
g framework. It has some nifty ideas=2C from a solid separation of transpo=
rt to simple custom resources and dedicated CLI tool.

A handy tool for anyone using Redis in a clustered setup. Redis Cluster To=
ol is a CLI app for checking the status of the cluster=2C rebalancing and=
 getting and setting configuration data.

If you=E2=80=99ve ever wanted to use Ruby natively in your shell=2C instea=
d of Bash=2C then Rush might be for you. Some nice examples and rationale.

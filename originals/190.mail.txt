ady built-in and enabled if your using Linux but not something I=E2=80=99v=
e seen used by many people.

A good case for people to stop sub-labelling devops=2C for instance as ent=
erprise devops or similar. Ultimately we=E2=80=99re better learning from a=
s wide a group of experiences as possible it seems to me.

Microservices are definitely hip=2C but not enough people are talking abou=
t the challenges in my experience. This post does a good job of pointing o=
ut complexity still exists=2C you=E2=80=99re just moving it elsewhere. Tha=
t elsewhere is often why stronger operations skills are in such demand.

Having a tool to help guide your programming style is incredibly useful=2C=
 both when learning a language and when aiming for consistency between dif=
ferent projects. Puppet Lint is just that tool for the Puppet language and=

 rules and the ability to automatically fix some issues.

Another deep-dive into AWS performance=2C this time looking at Route 53 DN=
S and in particular the new geolocation routing policy vs a latency based=

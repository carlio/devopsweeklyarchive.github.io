DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #173 - 27th April 2014

I=E2=80=99ve spent the last week on holiday in the lovely city of Budapest=
 and at the Craft conference on software craftsmanship. Once the videos st=
art coming out I=E2=80=99ll hopefully link to them as there was lots of gr=
eat talks=2C and it was interesting to be at an event with very few operat=
ions people for a change.

A pretty complete walk through of lots of the moving parts in CoreOS=2C in=
cluding using etcd and confd for configuration and using bringing up a clu=
ster on EC2 using CloudFormation.

One of my favourite talks at the recent Craft conference was this one on S=
oftware Craftsmanship. Lots worth taking to heart=2C from the importance o=
f API design to learning from research in our area.

My own talk from Craft=2C on continuous integration for infrastructure. A=
 set of patterns and tips for testing virtual machine images=2C automating=
 load testing and writing acceptance tests for provisioning systems.

Lots of systems are now distributed=2C with lots of parts joined together=
 by a network. This post does a good job of explaining why this is differe=
nt to an application running on a single machine. Lots of hard won tips ai=
med at people just getting started=2C but probably useful for everyone.

An interesting idea to formalise a schema for metrics. The site contains a=
 little of the how=2C along with a formal specification and links to a few=
 existing tools.

Every wanted to learn SELinux but thought it looked complex? Well this nex=
t link is for you. It=E2=80=99s  a colouring book which explains how SELin=
ux works. Yes=2C really.

A nice simple example of making monitoring more usable by linking alerts t=
o entries in a runbook. Usability tips and tricks like this are really use=
ful.

ng-runbooks-more-useful-by-exposing-them-through-monitoring.html


A call to stop using Jenkins and similar for continuous deployment pipelin=
es. Although I agree with the sentiment I=E2=80=99ve yet to see anything m=
assively better=2C at least in the open source space.

If you=E2=80=99re convincing Windows administrators and developers of the=
 benefits of infrastructure tooling (or anything) it=E2=80=99s often usefu=
l to have something from Microsoft to point to. This new site links to lot=
s of Windows specific tutorials and software releases under the devops ban=
ner.

Here=E2=80=99s a nice example of using Ansible to orchestrate a zero-downt=
ime deployment. Specifically we=E2=80=99re taking instances out of a load=
 balancer=2C deploying our application=2C re-adding to the load balancer a=
nd then moving on to the next one.

Events
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you=E2=80=99re interested in devops adoption in very large organisation=
s you will likely find the Devops Enterprise Summit pretty interesting. Oc=
tober 21st to 23rd in the San Francisco Bay area.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

There are a few tools cropping up recently that aim to make configuration=
 of load balancers more dynamic. Frontrunner works with Marathon and Mesos=
 only=2C but it=E2=80=99s an interesting way of configuring haproxy.

https://github.com/Wizcorp/frontrunner


As mentioned a few weeks ago the Go continuous delivery tool is now freely=
 available=2C and as of this last week the source code is now open source.=
 Will be interested to see if a community builds around this.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #119 - 14th April 2013

Devops has always been about more than collaboration between developers an=
d web operations and it's great to see articles like the first one in this=
 issue, in this case from deep within the network engineering community ta=
lking about the need to learn programming. At devops flavoured events talk=
 often turns to how to get more people from networking or quality assuranc=
e or security backgrounds to join the community, it feels like that might=
 be starting to happen.

News

A fantastic article, from a network engineers point of view on a network e=
ngineer site, about why network folk should learn programming. It doesn't=
 mention devops once. I still think one of the areas we'll see interesting=
 tools and conversations about in the next year or so will be networking.

It's very common for web applications to be moving towards a continuous re=
lease process, rather than say releasing a numbered version every 6 months=
=2E This blog post talks about this in terms of openstack (and is relevant t=
o other infrastructure software too I'd wager). Would you happily update y=
our IaaS software every day?

Interesting summary of the recent Heroku performance issues. This is mainl=
y interesting because it raises issues about who owns what when running un=
der a PaaS, and more importantly how you instrument an application when yo=
u don't own much of the stack.

As more and more folks implement deployment pipelines we're discovering us=
eful patterns. This post covers why just moving artefacts around between n=
amed repositories might not be the best approach, and why metadata is impo=
rtant too.

Assume you didn't already have any preconceptions about PHP and you heard=
 about a cool new language built for the web. PHP The Right Way is a actua=
lly quite impressive looking site aiming to improve the state of PHP docum=
entation, and starts with things like xdebug, dependency management tools,=
 built in web servers, vagrant and more.

Events

dotScale is an affordable upcoming conference in Paris, on June 7th with w=
orkshops on the June 8th. Som interesting folks down to speak, on everythi=

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

I mentioned the vagrant-omnibus tool last week for Chef and immediately wa=
nted to the same thing for Puppet. The first step is a single installer, a=
nd puppet-omnibus is just that. It uses the tools from Opscode to make a s=
ingle monolithic package.

Internal applications often have either no or bad authentication and autho=
risation schemes. Google Auth Proxy is a reverse proxy which authenticates=
 all requests via Google OAuth provider. Fast and simple, at least if you'=
re already using an OAuth provider like Google Apps.

More Vagrant providers, this one covers the Joyent cloud. Nicely it also c=
omes with a sample Vagrantfile in a hello world style project (including a=
 Chef bootstrap trick) which should get you started quickly.

Chronos is an interesting cron replacement, with a distributed, fault tole=
rant model based on Mesos. You can specify jobs in iso8601, interact with=
 a web interface or API and deal with failures gracefully. If you're runni=
ng a full Hadoop stack the dependencies shouldn't be too scary.

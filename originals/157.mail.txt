Lots of content this week as everyone seems to have spent at least some of=
 the time over the holidays hacking on tools or writing blog posts. Anyone=
 thinking that the new year is a great excuse to get back to writing regul=
arly is right.

Flapjack is basically a router for alerts and notifications from a monitor=
ing system. It=E2=80=99s not trying to do everything but does one thing ve=
ry well. This post explains where it fits and why you might want to give i=
t a try.

A post all about the changing landscape of network hardware=2C as generic=
 server hardware becomes much more capable of being used for switches and=
 routers. This is interesting to me as it likely makes software defined ne=
tworking easier=2C even with existing tools.

-and-networking/


Automation is not enough without adopting infrastructure as code practices=
=2C or so this post claims. A well reasoned argument that simply throwing=
 automation=2C especially packaged products=2C at a problem will cause pro=
blems without a software mindset.

The core language parser in Puppet has been getting some serious love for=
 a while now on the road towards Puppet 4=2C and this blog already has sev=
eral detailed posts about the new Type system.

A sort of ode to the role of a modern operations engineer. A great descrip=
tion of why the combination of typical operations activities and software=
 development are fulfilling and attractive to people.

A nice presentation about the changing role of testing in organisations th=
at are shipping software very frequently.

A description of the research techniques behind the recent Puppet Labs Dev=
ops survey=2C and some highlights from the findings of last years version.=
 Definitely worth using when convincing people of the benefits of a devops=
 approach.

I=E2=80=99ve been playing a bit with Serverspec for testing infrastructure=
 components recently. This post=2C and accompanying repo=2C demonstrates t=
esting Packer created images for AWS as part of a deployment pipeline.

An argument that continuous delivery is now mainstream. I=E2=80=99m not su=
re silicon valley companies like Google=2C Facebook and Amazon are much li=
ke your typical enterprise=2C but it=E2=80=99s a good collection of links=
 and talks about shipping rapidly at scale.

Early bird tickets are now on-sale for Craft in Budapest in April. Everyth=
ing from development process=2C testing=2C continuous integration (I=E2=80=
=99m speaking about continuous integration for infrastructure)=2C distribu=
ted systems and scaling to name a few topics.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

A very nice tool that provides code coverage measurements for Chef Spec te=
sts. The tooling around testing infrastructure code is becoming more and m=
ore mature every month it seems.

Another nice looking graphite dashboard. This one provides some structure=
 to metrics stored in graphites and allows querying via GEQL=2C Graph Expl=
orer Query Language.

Fig is like a combination of vagrant and docker=2C you define the services=
 which comprise your application in a YAML file and then type fig up to bo=
ot everything in docker containers.

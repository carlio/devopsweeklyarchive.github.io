DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #136 - 11th August 2013

Lots of content relevant to people working in large organisations this wee=
k. From risk management theatre to how to work devops into an ITIL minded=
 organisation. Most interestingly of all is an entire journal of devops fl=
avoured content from PWC. The rate which devops discussions have spread fr=
om the agile infrastructure days into mainstream organisations never cease=
s to amaze me.

Any discussion of changing processes within an organisation is bound to to=
uch on risk management. Unfortunately in some companies that means risk ma=
nagement theatre. This post explains what that looks like and what alterna=
tive approaches might look like.

If you work in a large company it=E2=80=99s quite likely you=E2=80=99ve co=
me across ITIL or other process frameworks. If so, this free ebook should=
 hopefully be of interest, aiming to provide a bridge between devops and I=
TIL.

Ever wondered whether openresty is faster for single requests than go? Or=
 whether finangle or nodejs are faster for writes? How does all of that di=
ffer if you=E2=80=99re running on AWS? These benchmarks cover 74 web frame=
works and runtimes and might be of interest if you=E2=80=99re comparing lo=
ts of technologies.

Events
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Registration and the call for proposals for devopsdays NYC are now open, w=
ith the event taking place on the 17th and 18th of October. Instead of pri=
nting yet another batch of conference t-shirts, devopsdays NYC is donating=
 the cost of the t-shirts to the non-profit Lotus Outreach which is provid=
ing clean drinking water to rural villages in Cambodia. No excuses not to=
 sign up if you=E2=80=99re in the area.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

NFT looks like an interesting tool for writing tests againts network serve=
rs. It provides tools for testing against DNS, HTTP and low level sockets,=
 as well as tools for running tests continuously and for storing and visua=
lising results over time.

Rockstack is an interesting approach to packaging up modern language runti=
mes around a consistent command line interface. So rather than remembering=
 differences between say running tests on Perl or Ruby or Python you can j=
ust run rock test.

Treating Infrastructure as code means taking testing configuration managem=
ent code seriously. Searchef is another piece of the puzzle if you=E2=80=
=99re using Chef, it allows for stubbing out calls to the Chef search serv=
er in your test code.

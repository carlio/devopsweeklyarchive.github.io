DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #179 - 8th June 2014

A couple of Devopsdays related posts this week made me head over to the De=
vopsdays site to see just how many events are happening. The map currently=
 has 11=2C from Brisbane to Walsaw=2C via Chicago and Belgium. Ghent in Oc=
tober is going to be some 5 year celebration.

A conversation about burnout has happened at more than one devopsdays even=
t=2C and while it might not be exclusive to IT roles it certainly feels co=
mmon enough that doing something and talking about it is useful. This new=
 site is a great starting place.

A nice writeup from the recent Devopsdays Pittsburgh event=2C focusing on=
 how well the organisers and attendees did at being approachable. This is=
 my experience of devopsdays events too=2C a great gathering of people wan=
ting to learn from each other.

The results of the 2014 Devops report have been published by Puppetlabs. B=
ased on a survey of nearly 10=2C000 people it contains lots of good observ=
ations=2C especially useful if you=E2=80=99re convincing senior colleagues=
 of the benefits.

An interesting opinion piece about the above mentioned report=2C and where=
 some of the conversation about devops might be moving to. I think we=E2=
=80=99re already seeing some of the this happening in business journals an=
d similar publications.

Whether you=E2=80=99re working with web applications or behind the scenes=
 services=2C you=E2=80=99ll probably be using HTTP somewhere. So it=E2=80=
=99s worth noting that the HTTP/1.1 RFC has just been replaced=2C by a ser=
ies of clearer and less ambiguous documents. Worth reading.

Ansible attempts to be very data centric=2C with the playbook files being=
 described in YAML. This makes testing a little different from unit testin=
g the Chef or Puppet DSL. This post shows one approach for testing Ansible=
 roles using Travis.

A nice set of strong cipher settings for Apache=2C Nginx and Lighttpd. Des=
igned to be copy and pasted by people who know what they are doing=2C but=
 a good example to study if you=E2=80=99re just looking at SSL.

Detailed instructions for getting a development environment setup for infr=
astructure work=2C in this case using Chef=2C AWS=2C Vagrant=2C Test Kitch=
en and Serverspec on OSX. The comments on workflow are particularly intere=
sting.

Another good writeup of a Chef development process. Some similarities to t=
he above post. The diagram in particular makes the intention nice and clea=
r.

A nice walkthrough of some of the advantages of using containers for manag=
ing a service based architecture. From rollbacks and canary releases to st=
andardisation and speed. Hopefully future parts in the series will contain=
 the technical implementation details.

Devops is most certainly not all about the tools=2C but our tools definite=
ly play a part. This post breaks down the choices in a few different commo=
n areas; configuration management=2C deployment=2C monitoring=2C version c=
ontrol and build systems. It=E2=80=99s a nice introduction to things to co=
nsider.

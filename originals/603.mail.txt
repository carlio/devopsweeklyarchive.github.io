Whether it=E2=80=99s relevant to the CEO will depend on the organisation=

Infrastructure self-service is often a question of the abstractions (or no=

Some thoughts on moving beyond Git for version control. It definitely feel=
s like a local maxima with Git. The consistency has had lots of benefits=
=2C but it still feels like a space with untapped opportunities. Also=2C i=

Often understanding the basics of how something works=2C makes it easier t=

OpenSLO is a specification for defining SLOs=2C intended to enable a commo=
n=2C vendor=E2=80=93agnostic approach to tracking and interfacing with SLO=
s. Interesting to see the Kubernetes API influence.

Salus is a new tool for generating an SBOM (software bill of materials). S=
pecifically it supports SPDX 2.2 and has some interesting file hash capabi=
lities. We=E2=80=99re seeing an explosion of tools like this recently.

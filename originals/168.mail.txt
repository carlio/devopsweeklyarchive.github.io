Lots of devops is about communication and sharing=2C and in most organisat=

mber of examples of team composition.

Interesting observations from attending an ITIL event followed by a Devops=

One of the advantages of continuous integration is having one shared place=

Adding performance testing to continuous integration pipelines can be tric=
ky - deciding when to run them=2C for how long and determining what to ass=

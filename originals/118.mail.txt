DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #118 - 7th April 2013

A busy week. Lots of interesting posts, jobs, events and tools to read up=
 on. The recent release of Vagrant 1.1 with the new plugin and provider mo=
del appears to have had the desired effect, I'm seeing lots of interesting=
 middleware and a few new providers which should make Vagrant even more of=
 an essential tool. If you've not upgraded it's well worth doing so.

The usages of the word devops are still evolving, and this post echoes lot=
 of my opinions on the matter. What is devops consulting and why might it=
 be the wrong description for various activities.

So much of devops is about communication between different disciplines. Th=
is post covers the need for technical literacy in more traditional areas o=
f a business. But much more than that it provides some concrete ways of go=
ing about building that literacy and explains why it's a good idea for eve=
ryone.

Ansible, the configuration management tool, sees a 1.1 release out this la=
st week with lots of new modules and new features. It looks like a regular=
 2 month release cycle should see lots of quick fire improvements.

Large organisations can benefit from devops just as much, or even more so,=
 than startups and small companies. But lots of enterprises have existing=
 processes, often based around ITIL. This post outlines a simple set of st=
eps to start having the devops conversation in an ITIL context.

Puppetlabs have released the results from the state of devops survey. As w=
ell as the infographics the full report is 10 pages of data and analysis.=

 and what benefits people are seeing.

A nice follow up to the monitorama conference last week, this post covers=
 one of the focuses of the conference, what does a modern monitoring stack=
 look like. This is part snippets from different talks, part personal expe=
rience report and part notes about types of problems faced by Openstack an=
d where different tools might fit in. Interesting read.

Vagrant 1.1 shipped with the ability to have multiple providers, for insta=
nce for different cloud providers. Brightbox, who sponsor this newsletter,=
 have quickly shipped a provider for their IaaS platform. A few useful tri=
cks here for anyone else building providers - like using rsync for the sha=
red folder support, meaning the shell, puppet and chef provisioner's shoul=
d just work.

A very useful looking vagrant plugin for Chef users. This middleware ensur=
es that Chef is installed at the specified version, particularly handy if=
 using a provider and/or basebox that doesn't have Chef installed.

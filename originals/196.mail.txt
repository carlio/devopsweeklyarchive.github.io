DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #196 - 5th October 2014

I talked at PupppetConf about how I think we=E2=80=99re still edging slowl=
y towards infrastructure as code. A few of the links before point in that=
 direction=2C with automated test suites for black box services=2C interac=
tive ways of exploring infrastructure and tools for learning to code. More=
 of the same please.

A good write-up from my old colleagues about how they approached writing a=
cceptance tests for a Content Distribution Network. Black box testing like=
 this feels useful for a bunch of different services or devices.

Devops owes lots to the discussion of agile that came before it=2C one of=
 those discussions being around the importance of cross functional teams.=
 This post stresses why having a real team is so important.

This next post talks about the importance to code review=2C and about maki=
ng that easier with pre-checks like static analysis. The reason I like it=
 is because it shows how simple this can be in trivial cases. Easy to forg=
et when moving to describing infrastructure as code.

If you=E2=80=99ve managed a reasonable sized AWS infrastructure you=E2=80=
=99ll probably have spent at least some time looking for an instance based=
 on incomplete data. Skew sounds an interesting solution=2C I=E2=80=99m pa=
rticularly interested in seeing the IPython Notebook integration.

It=E2=80=99s been a week or since PuppetConf 2014 now so most of the slide=
s are now available online. That=E2=80=99s nearly 100 presentations to kee=
p you busy.

Quite a few nice points in this interview with RedHat CEO putting the busi=
ness spin on devops. Interesting following the CEO/CIO discussions around=
 something that is so community driven.

A follow up to a post I included a few weeks back=2C all about why leading=
 people and management could be for you. Managers play a big part in how c=
ulture changes in most organisations and it=E2=80=99s often ignored by tec=
hnology driven employees.

nd automation.

A good talk (slides=2C video and a transcript) all about the inevitability=
 of failure and why and how you should design your organisations and teams=
 to deal with it.

With the potential cost of even a minor outage in some organisations being=
 so high=2C the fallout afterwards could result in someone losing their jo=
b. Is this ever reasonable? And what other effects does that have on a tea=
m trying to build a learning culture?

Lots of opinions and recommendations exist for securing TLS configurations=
 but this paper from Cornell is both bang up-to-date and goes into all the=
 details. I=E2=80=99d like to include more papers=2C so if anyone comes ac=
ross good ones let me know.

A good story of evolving an infrastructure=2C in this case mixing Chef wit=
h AWS CloudFormation and a new tool called Cloudbank. Some interesting cod=
e samples and ideas.

A good slide deck on the evolution of a devops culture at Target. Lots of=
 good numbers=2C along with tips for getting through the required change.=
 Another of the great talks from Devopsdays Minneapolis.

One area that differs between Windows and Unix like environments is remote=
 management. This Powershell module contains most of what you need to mana=
ge systems over SSH from within Powershell=2C lots of cross platform manag=
ement options here.

A good walkthrough of taking a fairly verbose Puppet manifest and using R1=
0K to manage external dependencies and Hiera to better model the resulting=
 infrastructure as data rather tha code.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Devstep is described as a development environment builder powered by Docke=
r and buildpacks. The getting started docs give you a flavour of the workf=
low and a list of the current buildpacks.

Infrataster is another tool for writing unit tests for infrastructure. It=
=E2=80=99s designed to complement serverspec=2C by focusing on running tes=
ts from outside the virtual machine to test external interfaces like HTTP=
 or SSH.

Uchiwa looks like a great addition to the Sensu monitoring framework. The=
 screenshots give you an idea about it=E2=80=99s capabilities. It=E2=80=99=
s also packaged as a docker container which I think is something we=E2=80=
=99ll see more and more of.

Goiardi is a Chef server written in Go with the ability to run entirely in=
 memory=2C with optional persistence saving the in-memory data to disk or=
 using MySQL or Postgres. I=E2=80=99m not sure of the why in this case=2C=
 but having open integration test suites make this an interesting possibil=
ity.

Another log parsing tool=2C Petit has a number of impressive features from=
 hashing=2C graphing and discovering important repeated items in log files=

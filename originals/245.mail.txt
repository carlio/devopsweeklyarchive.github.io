dern production stack. Everything from the container engine to bootstrappi=
ng tools to orchestration.

An excellent article on how one team adopted a microservices architecture=
=2C focused on the process gains and an understanding of the value stream=
 map of going from idea to production.

Keeping Docker images small can be tricky=2C especially for applications f=
or lots of dependencies. This post shows how to create small images for Ru=
by applications=2C but the approach should be valid for similar runtimes.

An entire free textbook=2C entitled Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces.=
 Covering virtualization=2C concurrency and persistence as they relate to=
 operating systems=2C the book also goes into scheduling the CPU=2C memory=
 management=2C persistent storage and more.

A good discussion piece on whether Docker brings anything to development e=
nvironments. I think to a degree this depends on your development environm=
ent.

A good reminder that adding more powerful management software comes at a c=
ost of exposing those capabilities to attackers. Securing not just access=
 but the capabilities of automation is going to become increasingly import=
ant.

A presentation from this week=E2=80=99s Software Circus event=2C all about=
 the interest in an operating system that spans multiple hosts.

An interesting observation about human error in typing our prose=2C and ho=
w that affects user input for things like command line applications which=
 require long inputs. The article doesn=E2=80=99t mention writing tests or=
 TDD as part of a possible solution.

Tools

Whether the contents of a container present a security risk has been much=
 discussed=2C and we=E2=80=99re starting to see tools emerge to help answe=
r and automate parts of the problem. This example uses OpenSCAP to scan Do=
cker containers=2C though this requires a SCAP profile for your chosen OS/=
image.

https://github.com/OpenSCAP/container-compliance


Dinit is a nice looking solution to running multiple processes inside a Do=
cker container. It=E2=80=99s not a full init system which keeps things sim=
ple=2C and aims to fit well into a typical Docker build process.

Applikatoni looks like a nice=2C simple deployment server and provides a w=
eb based dashboard and CLI for a team to trigger and see software deployme=
nts.

rtop-bot is a simple chat bot for bringing basic monitoring data to your S=
lack or HipChat room. Under the hood it simply SSH=E2=80=99s into machines=
 to collect data on load=2C CPU and memory usage.

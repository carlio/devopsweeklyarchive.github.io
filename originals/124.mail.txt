The focus at RICON East, the conference organised by Basho who make Riak,=

ems.

A super comprehensive write-up of lots of the talks from RICON East. Gets=
 across the mix of academic and practical talks that seemed to be the focu=
s of the event.

How do you go about picking the programming language for a real world appl=
ication? After covering a series of non-optimal (but familiar) answers the=
 talk goes into a few strategies you can use to select emerging languages=
 safely.

The start of a series of posts, following on from a RICON presentation, al=
l about how different systems and databases handle network partitions when=
 running in a cluster. Lots of good theory but combined with practical bit=
s of software you're probably running at work.

ting all the links to slides, blog posts and online discussions on the fol=
lowing Gist. You can even listen to the conference music playlist.

The relationship between programming and the trade of systems administrati=
on is interesting, and this post gives some great tips for moving from scr=
ipting applications together and being a jack of all languages towards bei=
ng a competent programmer.

Very interesting post placing devops in the context of a maturing IT envir=
onment and an increase in critical thinking about what we do and how we st=
ructure ourselves. Makes lots of interesting points about the presence of=
 silos within organisations, and how this isn't just a negative thing.

A good pulling together of information about Google's development process,=
 focusing on the use of trunk based development and minimising branches. L=
ots of details about the tooling and people processes that make this work=
 well for them.

The fourth and final piece in this series focusing on devops in a traditio=
nal enterprise company. This post covers release management, what do you d=
o when "continuous deployment merely appears as a small dot far away on th=
e horizon, practised by whizkids and Einsteins living on a different plane=
t."

We're collecting ever more data for monitoring purposes and finding the si=
gnal in all the noise can be tricky. Increasingly statistical techniques w=
ill be the way to go, this post covers the basics of anomaly detection in=
 particular whether your data is parametric or non-parametric.

A light hearted take on going from a project with no automation up to a fu=
lly automated and resilient infrastructure stack, with an idea of the diff=
erent stages of advancement.

An introduction to Devops for people on the business side, focusing on a f=
ew personal stories of success, anti-patterns and the areas of culture, au=
tomation, measurement and sharing.

A good example of the advantages of OS level init systems in general and s=
ystemd in particular. In this case for managing a node.js application but=
 much of the content is applicable to anything.

As someone who works a lot with Ruby based tools I know how much of a pain=
 the Ruby ecosystem can be. So posts like this that introduce the various=
 moving parts are essential, especially with both Puppet and Chef benefiti=
ng from some Ruby knowledge.

RAMP is an international tech conference on Scalability, to be held in Bud=
apest, Hungary on 11-12 July 2013. RAMP will feature stories from engineer=
s and tech founders about the race against exploding traffic, architecture=
s that didn=E2=80=99t cut it, and all that goes into scaling systems and e=
ngineering teams when a product goes from 1 to 100m users. I'll be speakin=
g too so if you're going to be there let me know or come say Hi.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Vagrant is moving very quickly, and the move to a system package rather th=
an a gem removed the ability to easily depend on different versions from w=
ithin Ruby projects. Enter vagrant-wrapper.

mcomaster is a web interface to the mcollective server orchestration tool.=
 It provides the ability to run commands and see the results and to filter=
 nodes by the available metadata.

Related to the Ruby toolchain post above, chruby is yet another way of man=
aging versions of Ruby. chruby aims to do far less however than the existi=
ng crop of tools, and might be of interest in some circumstances.

Circus is an interesting looking Python application for managing processes=
 and sockets. It removes the need for certain types of WSGI server and at=
 the same time provides a great deal of stats and a very nice looking dash=
board.

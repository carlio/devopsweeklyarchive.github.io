es to a simpler approach to microservices with SCS.

There are lots of arguments for the various practices often seen with devo=
ps. This post makes a strong economic argument focused on learning quickly=
 in small batches.

A solid argument that multi-cloud approaches should probably not be the de=
fault for the majority of users when considering either lock-in or disaste=
r recovery.

A similar conclusion to the issue of lock-in for serverless=2C but with a=
 different rationale. Lock-in is fairly dependent on context in my experie=
nce=2C and more important in some areas and organisations than others whic=
h isn=E2=80=99t mentioned here.

Some folks have very strong opinions when it comes to continuous integrati=
on. This post derives a scoring system you can use as a health check for t=
eams=2C if you agree with the philosophy around trunk-based development.

A nice example of the power of event driven infrastructure=2C using CloudW=

utoscaling instances.

An interesting proposal for a slightly different take on microservice arch=
itectures=2C named Self Contained Systems (or SCS). The idea appears to be=
 to sacrifice some tenets of microservices to make deployment simpler.

This post makes the case that there are lots of hello-world Kubernetes exa=

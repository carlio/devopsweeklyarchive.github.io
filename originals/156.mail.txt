Anomaly detection was definitely one of the themes of lots of monitoring c=
onversations this year. So crucible should be handy for people working in=
 this area. It=E2=80=99s a small tool for testing detection algorithms=2C=

Docket is another tool intended for use with Docker=2C looking to move con=
figuration and the docker images into version control with Git. Docket int=
roduces a simple config file and has good getting started documentation an=
d examples.

I=E2=80=99m quite a fan of code analysis tools but linking lots of them to=
gether and then using the output can be time consuming. Prospector looks i=
nteresting for Python folks=2C aiming to integrate pep8=2C pylint=2C pyfla=
kes and complexity scores with an understanding of common frameworks like=
 Django.

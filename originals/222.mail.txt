Viewing containers as just another packaging format leads you to miss the=
 typical metadata available to tools like apt and yum. This post demonstra=
tes a clever approach to fixing this problem=2C making containers much les=
s of a black box.

I=E2=80=99ve always found choosing technology interesting=2C how=2C if and=
 when to adopt newer technology is very contextual and knowing whether you=
 got it right takes time. This post does a great job of both telling a sto=
ry but also providing ideas for how to go about technology choice.

One of the things that came out of Chef conf (if you were there please sen=

A good post on one of the advantages of using containers=2C that of improv=
ing utilisation and reducing costs=2C by making multi-tenant systems easie=
r. It doesn=E2=80=99t touch on the increased network complexity in those s=
ituations but covers lots of other good points.

A good call to action for security teams to adopt devops practices=2C high=

ening anyway.

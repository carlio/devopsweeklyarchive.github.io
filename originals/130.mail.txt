DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #130 - 30th June 2013

A bit of a mix of new tools, old tools, tutorials, presentations and intro=
ductions this week. Oh, and a new Linux based operating system with some i=
deas I'd love to see adopted elsewhere.

Graphite is a pretty powerful tool, but it's not the easiest thing to get=
 a good understanding of. This post covers tips for naming metrics as well=
 as code examples of now to instrument a few Ruby classes. Useful whatever=
 language you're using.

Using libraries from sites like ruby gems or npm is an interesting securit=
y challenge. This post explains why, with a great social engineering examp=
le and also shows how you can run your own gem server.

Interesting analysis of the AWS EC2 API, focusing on the eventually consis=
tent nature of some calls and the expected response times. Some good tips=
 for writing or using EC2 clients, but also a nicely documented approach y=
ou could apply to other similar APIs.

NixOS is a new flavour of Linux, but what caught my eye was the package ma=
nagement system Nix. It's based on functional programming which means that=
 it can ensure that an upgrade to one package cannot break others, that yo=
u can always roll back to previous versions and that multiple versions of=
 a package can coexist on the same system. It also supports multiple users=
 and a built-in configuration management tool.

Systems are increasingly being built out of small services composed togeth=
er. This post is a good introduction to why this approach has emerged and=
 what some of the advantages and disadvantages are.

Nice presentation on the changing role of Quality Assurance and Testers wi=
thin organisations taking a Devops approach. Lots of before and after exam=
ples and an attempt to explain why things should change.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Packer is a standardised tool chain for creating base images for different=
 platforms, including virtualbox, aws, vsphere, etc. It's ideal for automa=
ting this sometimes tricky task. The 0.1 release doesn't support ever hype=
rvisor or provider yet but the plugin architecture means it can do in the=
 future.

Ever wanted to use a Chef cookbook but not wanted to alter maybe one line=
 to make it work for your setup? Chef rewind will modify some properties o=
f a resource, during the complile phase, before chef-client actually start=
s the run phase.

Flapjack is a distributed monitoring notification system I've mentioned pr=
eviously. Getting up and running with all the bits however could prove tri=
cky so here's a way of building omnibus packages for it. It's also a good=
 example of using the omnibus tool.

If you're looking for a simple provisioning tool in Ruby then Orca might b=
e of interest. It's aimed at a space between deployment tools like Capistr=
ano and configuration management tools like Chef and Puppet, and provides=
 a small DSL which deals with simple cases.

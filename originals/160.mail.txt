A post on what hero culture can look like in operations teams and why it i=
s both useful and dangerous in the long term. Introduced by a story that I=
=E2=80=99m sure is familiar to a few people.

A nice response to a post I featured last week about Enterprise IT needing=
 different things from devops. The example given=2C challenging existing c=
hange control processes using infrastructure as code=2C is a good one. We=
 should document more of these patterns as a community.

Writing good Chef cookbooks involves lots of moving parts=2C and learning=
 a few tools for unit or integration testing=2C linting=2C dependency mana=
gement=2Cetc. This post covers using a new tool called Meez to make gettin=
g started much easier.

A detailed post about some of the changing patterns for infrastructure dep=
loyment=2C particularly looking at using entire machine images as build ar=
tefacts. It touches on some of the newly introduced complexity but more ac=
tual examples would be useful.

Nice short presentation going over some of the misconceptions that large o=
rganisations can have about devops.

Given the short history of the term devops I=E2=80=99m not sure I buy the=
 need for a sort-of eulogy just yet=2C but if you think devops is just sys=
tems administration=2C or a name for a new set of tools=2C then you should=
 read this post.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #126 - 2nd June 2013

I think this might be one of the most packed issues of Devops Weekly for a=
 while. I've been on holiday for most of the week but still found myself f=
alling over excellent content when I got back. Discussions of risk, useful=
 tools I want to start using if I can find the time, upcoming events not t=
o be missed, the opportunity to be a TV presenter for the amazing Opschool=
 and a few interesting jobs for anyone on the lookout in London. Enjoy.

If you've ever thought of devops as a "throughput-optimizing, process-acce=
lerating, agility-creating, workflow-throttling threat to your very bureau=
cratic existence" then this next post is for you. A useful (and suprisingl=
y funny) reminder than some people will need convincing about the benefits=
 of devops.

The nice folks at 10gen are are running a survey about how you collect, st=
ore and use your data. The information collected should be more useful the=
 more people complete it, I'll keep an eye out for the results being publi=
shed too.

A good example of someone using the Dashing dashboard framework. Includes=
 some code samples for getting information from Icinga, Twitter and Drupal=
 but it's also just a good example of what's possible.

Knowing how to debug a problem with a running server is important, in orde=
r to fix the problem and also so software you build is easier to debug. Th=
is post covers a good list of things to check from a beginners point of vi=
ew, looking at tools like history, free, dmesg, netstat, vmstat, pstree an=
d lots more. A handy refresher or a good starting point.

Nice presentation all about the Etsy DevTools team. Goes into what they do=
 and why they exist and runs through some of the tools they have developed=
 to help Etsy ship code.

The topic of web operations moving from a craft to a science crops up regu=
larly, and this post covers the science. Looking at the maths around mean-=
time-to-recovery and mean-time-between-failure and defining risk in IT sys=
tems. Ends asking people to share numbers like this to further research, a=
lthough I'd be interested in traditional enterprises as well as the new te=
chnology titans.

Another post about managing risk, this one discussing "what is the risk th=
at amazon will goo down". Some interesting points, and if you're intereste=
d in risk and human factors the references section contains some great rea=
ding material.

o-down-again.html


Good presentation on using the fire hose of logs and monitoring data for s=
ecurity and compliance purposes. The examples are from Etsy who use Splunk=
 but lots of good ideas for most environments with payments, user accounts=
 or a dynamic web application.

The Heroku Platform API is now available in beta. This is a nice HTTP API=
 to controlling all the innards of Heroku. Everything from reading and wri=
ting configuration variables, creating new applications, adding or changin=
g addons. Expect lots of interesting things to be built on this.

A video presentation about using Docker (the rather nice LXC container wra=
pper) to build your own Platform as a Service. It's a very simple toy exam=
ple but shows how little code is required to do something quite powerful w=
ith docker.

Scaling non-trivial applications across multiple data centres can be diffi=
cult, this post aims to document some of the main things to consider. If y=
ou're looking to do this in the future this post might be a good starting=
 point.

I've featured a few of these talks previously, but all of the excellent mo=
nitorama talks are now available in one place, both slides and videos. Thi=
s was one of the most information packed two day events I've been to and I=
'm already looking forward to Monitarama.eu in Berlin later this year.

One persons experience getting started with Chef and Vagrant. Good notes a=
nd observations about what this particular team found useful and what they=
 found difficult or frustrating. Worth reading if you're new to the tools=
 or if you're writing tools for developers.

omorrow but the call for proposals is open now until July 1st.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Graph Explorer is an alternative dashboard for Graphite. It provides some=
 nice tool to create interactive and real time graphs, group related metri=
cs and compose graphs using regex, tags or other queries. Lots of screensh=
ots and a video should give you an idea of what it's capable of.

Omnibus packages help isolate applications from underlying dependencies. T=
his project builds a package for Puppet, using the Omnibus installer from=
 Opscode. The projects comes with a Vagranfile which makes building packag=
es for different operating systems easy too.

If you're using Vagrant you're probably downloading package data over and=
 over as you happily start and destroy boxes. Vagrant Cachier looks like a=
 neat solution to speed this up, creating a cache of packages on your host=
 machine which can be used by the guests. It supports multiple package man=
agers too.

3 interesting observations about adopting public cloud when coming from tr=
aditional infrastructure; the cloud has its own CMDB=2C the only thing tha=
t knows about a thing is itself=2C and the advantage of cloud is flexibili=
ty.

A great post on devops and security=2C from the security engineering persp=
ective. Some good practical tips including embedding security engineers in=
 engineering teams (and vice versa)=2C gamification and more.

Argo introduces some interesting higher-level concepts into Kubernetes=2C=
 including AppProject which allows for a project container to tie together=
 other resources.

Containers are for stateless services=2C or so the tale goes. In reality l=
ots of people are running databases in containers. This post=2C focused on=
 PostgreSQL=2C makes the case that the benefits often outweigh the disadva=
ntages.

I like arguments against the zeitgeist=2C like this post on scaling issues=
 with GitOps. I think there are some assumptions here that=2C if you are a=
re building for scale you can address with automation=2C or are fundamenta=
l to scale rather than the approach=2C but I like the debate.

Cloud migration in large=2C complex organisations is invariably a lot more=
 complicated that it might first appear=2C partly because it=E2=80=99s as=
 much about people and structures as technology. Some good observations al=
ong those lines in this next post.

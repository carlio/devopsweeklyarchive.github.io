The post I included about Nagios last week caused quite a good debate on t=
he internet somewhere. Here=E2=80=99s a good response about why you might=
 be best sticking with Nagios after all.

Lots of conversations around devops concern how to break down organisation=
al silos. This post delves nicely into why they exist.

LXC=2C the Linux Containers project=2C has shipped a 1.0 release=2C which=
 comes with 5 years of long term support and a slew of new features. From=
 the maintainers point of which this is now considered stable for producti=
on.

Running your application inside a container is all the rage at the moment.=
 But as this post points out=2C if you=E2=80=99re using docker you=E2=80=
=99re doing a lot more than that - you=E2=80=99re running a minimal OS=2C=
 but without various expected services like syslog=2C cron=2C ssh=2C etc.

iguration management=2C infrastructure orchestration and devops. The conte=
nt is on GitHub so pull requested accepted.

A common pattern in organisations embracing devops is a move towards self-=
service. This post brings up a bit of history and outlines some of the adv=
antages of a self-service operating model.

I wrote a post last week about the buy vs build quandary when it comes to=
 monitoring systems. This was based on conversations at the recent London=
 Devops meetup. I=E2=80=99d like to see more conversations around cost and=
 business topics as they apply to development and operations.

Velocity
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I managed to somehow do a talk at Velocity where I debated myself on the t=
opic of software adoption=2C focusing on the Google Infrastructure for Eve=
ryone Else meme.

provement and learning=2C and the addition and building of tools to improv=
e the operator experience.

This talk covered the importance of design to building an effective securi=
ty organisation. Lots of good tips and a good reminder that security is a=
 wide ranging multi-disciplinary activity.

Similar to the Nagios talk above=2C this one covers the evolution of Elast=
icSearch=2C Logstash and Kibana in the same organisation. I like this form=

DockerCon
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

One of the announcements that got the most interest at DockerCon was the n=
ew swarm integration. This post explores the new service model and the bui=
lt-in load balancer.

I also got to speak at DockerCon=2C on The Dockerfile explosion and the ne=
ed for higher level tools. All about scaling image build=2C with some idea=
s for the future and a run through various community tools.

A handy set of blog posts with notes from both DockerCon keynotes. The fir=
st covers new software or updates to docker. Day 2 focused on partnerships=
 and the ecosystem.

Inspired by the closing demos at DockerCon=2C this post demonstrates an ap=
proach to using docker to provide a function as a service/serverless frame=
work this time in Go.

News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Pets vs Cattle metaphor is oft-used. This post makes the case that it=
=E2=80=99s no longer a useful way of talking about our systems=2C in parti=
cular because the reality is a blur of state of converged systems.

If you=E2=80=99ve ever wanted to monitor or tune the linux networking stac=

A good post exploring the AWS ElasticSearch service. Interesting to read e=
ven if you=E2=80=99re not an ES user as it has a number of good points for=
 anyone designing SaaS interfaces for existing software.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

There's been an explosion of tools recently for bootstrapping a Kubernetes=
 or Docker cluster. Spread is one such tool=2C but with a few nice looking=
 features around reproducibility.

Entropy is a fault injection system for Docker based systems. Define a pol=
icy and point it at your docker endpoints to trigger failures of container=
s to aid with building resilient systems.

If you already have a reasonable size AWS setup=2C adopting a tool like Cl=
oudFormation can mean a lot of re-work. Bellerophon aims to generate CF te=
mplates automatically from existing AWS resources by querying the API.

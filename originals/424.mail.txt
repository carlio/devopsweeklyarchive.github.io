A bit of a security theme this week=2C with posts on formal methods for fi=
rewall configuration=2C tools for managing TLS=2C discussions of the role=
 of perimeter defence and an interesting Kubernetes case study. Lots more=
 content too on monitoring and scaling devops in large organisations.

The use of formal methods is often seen as an academic subject=2C but this=
 post explores a practical use the Z3 constraint solver to test firewall r=
ules.

Step Certificates is an open source project that makes secure automated ce=
rtificate management simpler=2C making it much easier to use TLS to secure=
 services.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #247 - 27th September 2015

I attended the first WinOps conference this week=2C focused on Devops prac=
tices in Windows environments. The interesting part was how much of the au=
dience was new to everything Devops - it=E2=80=99s worth remembering that=
 if you=E2=80=99re thinking about writing or talking about something and n=
ot sure what to cover. We still need lots more good introductory material=
 out there.

It=E2=80=99s often too easy for sensitive information to end up publicly a=
ccessible on GitHub=2C whether that=E2=80=99s git tokens=2C SSH private ke=
ys or AWS credentials. Gitrob is a tool aimed an internal security folk fo=
r finding that information before it can be used against you.

A nice description of the utility of the CoreOS toolbox=2C a pattern that=
=E2=80=99s applicable to any minimal OS/container combination. The idea th=

The Goat Farm is a relatively new podcast focused on Devops practices in l=
arge enterprise organisations. 9 episodes in and it has some great intervi=

 stories to share get in touch with the presenters.

One of the talks from Operability this week=2C on common problems with log=
ging and how to fix them. Some good points about why it=E2=80=99s importan=
t to log accurate and useful information too.

Another talk from Operability=2C this one by me entitled operations withou=
t the operating system. How does operations change as the OS becomes drast=
ically simpler or disappears entirely?

Confidentiality=2C integrity and availability is a common way of talking a=
bout information security. This handy presentation maps those concepts to=
 devops practices=2C likely a great way of building bridges between ops an=
d security.

An impassioned plea to sell the business value of being able to deploy sof=
tware early in a project. A good reminder that this isn=E2=80=99t a given=
 everywhere.

Tools

es like integration with service management frameworks=2C hot reloading of=
 configuration=2C exposing metrics over HTTP and an API for configuration.

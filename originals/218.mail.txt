A great definition of microservices as =E2=80=9Csoftware that fits in your=

head


Sysdig (the super powerful tracing application) has just added the ability=
 to inspect processes inside containers. This allows for=2C for instance=
=2C showing CPU usage across containers on a host running in different con=
tainer implementations like LXC and Docker. Lots of great examples in the=

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

A new CI system with a very pipeline native setup. It=E2=80=99s automatica=

A collection of Puppet modules and scripts aimed at compliance with more t=
han 1000 requirements from nine US Department of Defence policy documents.=

The combination of low level system tools with embedded scripting with Lua=
 is=2C I think/hope=2C one we=E2=80=99ll see more of. Nginx already does t=
his well. go-lua is a Lua runtime for Go=2C which I=E2=80=99d love to see=
 in the emerging Go system tools.

Curl is amazing=2C but it=E2=80=99s also somewhat cryptic. Httpie is a a C=
url replacement designed with a more friendly=2C and HTTP native=2C interf=
ace.

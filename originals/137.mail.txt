ISSUE #137 - 18th August 2013

I'm in San Francisco this coming week for PuppetConf. If anyone is around=
 and wants to meetup let me know at @garethr on Twitter. If I've got the t=
iming right next weeks issue should be written from San Francisco airport=
=2C if not it might be late Monday for the next instalment of Devops Weekl=
y.

I=E2=80=99ve seen quite a bit of interest recently about measuring communi=
ty engagement. This post pulls lots of numbers from the Chef community=2C=
 in particular showing the growth of the Chef community cookbooks site and=
 mailing list and IRC chatter.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you=E2=80=99re like me you often have several Vagrant managed boxes aro=
und for different projects. The vagrant global status plugin might therefo=
re be useful=2C it tracks all your vagrant machines state=2C making it eas=
ier to track which boxes are currently running.

Marelle is a new configuration management and systems administration frame=
work written in Prolog. It=E2=80=99s not designed to be as large as Chef o=
r Puppet=2C but the logic based programming approach is certainly interest=
ing.

Lots of tooling around docker at the moment. Maestro allows for describing=
 multiple docker containers and their dependencies=2C and then managing th=
em via a simple command line interface.

Vegeta is a command line load testing tool written in Go. It allows you to=
 specify a constant request rate=2C and can output results as text or SVG.=
 The interface is certainly simpler than similar tools like ab or httperf.

Nginx is an incredibly useful and powerful piece of software=2C but I find=
 you often want to roll your own packages to include one module or another=
=2E This omnibus installer helps with automating building those packages=2C=
 and already includes lots of nginx modules including the openresty distri=
bution.

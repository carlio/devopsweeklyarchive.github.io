DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #184 - 13th July 2014

One blog post and a few tools this week confirming something I=E2=80=99ve=
 been seeing too; traditional networking is definitely becoming more inter=
esting to the devops community.

A good reflections on Devopsdays Silicon Valley post=2C focusing on a obse=
rvation I=E2=80=99d made as well=2C an increase in interest in all things=
 networking at Devops events.

A nice devops in an enterprise presentation with a few nice ideas=2C espec=
ially for communicating intent to colleagues from other areas of the organ=
isation. I particularly liked the pace of change visualisation and discuss=
ion.

A nice reminder that any topic of interest=2C and especially devops=2C is=
 built on top of previous endeavours. Would devops exist without ITIL or t=
he work of Deming? Learn from past work without being constrained by it.

-fields-and-communities/


A good call for developers to involve operations folks in the early stages=
 of a project. My experience here is that devops is introduced from differ=
ent places in different orgs=2C so the problem isn=E2=80=99t universal - b=
ut it=E2=80=99s still a good reminder.

A nicely documented example of building up a Jenkins continuous integratio=
n setup using ansible=2C and using docker to isolate test runs. Lots of co=
de examples.

A pretty detailed post about when and whether to use software as a service=
 over something a little more self-hosted=2C in particular looking at vers=
ion control systems in the light of the recent Code Spaces episode.

A nice short deck on the importance of investing in your Puppet developmen=
t workflow=2C going through a number of tools and processes and different=
 approaches. Some good ideas for useful tools here too.

Haka is described as an open source security oriented language which allow=
s to apply security policies on (live) captured traffic. It=E2=80=99s base=
d on Lua and looks to be a great way of writing certain kinds of network t=
ools.

Another interesting networking stack=2C again using Lua (LuaJit in this ca=
se). Snabb Switch is designed for high throughput=2C low latency network s=
ytems suitable for use by ISPs. It speaks natively to ethernet hardware=2C=
 hypervisors=2C and the linux kernel. Interesting times for networking.

An interesting approach to server authentication=2C swapping the Authorize=
dKeysCommand for a custom application which checks keys published to GitHu=
b rather than a local public key. The examples directory makes understandi=
ng how it works nice and easy.

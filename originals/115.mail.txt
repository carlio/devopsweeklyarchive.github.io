DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #115 - 17th March 2013

I've spent the last two days helping to organise the excellent Devopsdays=
 conference in London. From the feedback I've seen so far everyone had as=
 good a time as me, thanks again to all the sponsors, speakers and attende=
es who made the event awesome. If you're part of this community you should=
 think about getting along to a near-by event, or even getting together wi=
th a few people to organise something. Putting lots of smart, passionate p=
eople together in one place really is a great way of learning.

Nice write-up of all the sessions, along with some thoughts about the form=
at of the two days. Lots of links to slides, books and other resources men=
tioned in the talks and open space sessions.

One of the open space sessions I attended was all about community resource=
s for learning about Devops. These notes from the person who ran the sessi=
on are a great resource on their own, with links to events, podcasts, blog=
s, books and even this newsletter.

Slides from one of the Devopsdays London talks, this one from Niek Barthol=
omeus all about Devops for Dinosaurs. The topic is all about bringing devo=
ps culture and modern tooling to a large enterprise environment, based on=
 a great in-depth case study.

Another of the Devopsdays London presentation that I've found, this one fr=
om Gene Kim all about how best to sell your boss or your organisation on a=
dopting devops. Mapping business failings to developer failings looks a gr=
eat way to get different people to understand the problem from their own p=
oint of view.

More notes from Devopsdays London, this time covering all the talks and ig=
nites. The notes are drawn from tweets made during the talks, but you can=
 follow along with the topics surprisingly well.

One of the ignite talks, entitled What if configuration management was cre=
ated by game designers. Lots of interesting ideas, from rewards, high scor=
es, virtual currency, cheats, health and more.

News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

A few people might remember Flapjack, which aimed to be a next generation=
 monitoring tool. Due to various reasons it has been superceded by tools l=
ike Sensu which have a similar focus. Well now Flapjack has been rebooted,=
 aimed at being the part of the monitoring puzzle that deals with alerts,=
 roll-ups and notifications. Well worth talking a look at.

Docker is the soon to be open sourced container runtime from the folks at=
 dotcloud. It's aim is to be a building block for building isolated runtim=
e environments, using LXC under the hood to isolate everything and hopeful=
ly provide a general approach to specific tools like virtualenv, rvm gemse=
ts, etc.

I'm finding quite a few presentations and videos about practical scaling t=
ips for small companies, most of them quite rightly focusing as much on no=
t doing some things and what to do. This talk from Ruby Australia focuses=
 on Rails, but nearly all the advice should be applicable to any startup o=
r small company.

Interesting presentation from the development team at SoundCloud about how=
 they are migrating away from monolithic Rails applications to a running s=
mall services on the JVM as they grow. Lots of good tips and experience, i=
n particular about making the cost of experimenting low - they are current=
ly using JRuby, Scala and Clojure to find which fits best.

Some interesting survey results about barriers to adopting a continuous de=
livery model. Findings include organisational culture, lack of integrated=
 development and operations, technical hurdles and a general lack of under=
standing. Worth reading some of the conclusions.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

One of the tools mentioned in a talk at Devopsdays London was Deploykit, f=
rom Future publishing. The talk went into more detail but this was an atte=
mpt to make a generic deployment tool that uses message queues for much of=
 the internal communication.

https://github.com/FuturePublishing/future-deploykit


Vagabond is an alternative take on the Vagrant tool, but one based on LXC=
 rather than virtual machines after the realisation that VMs can be quite=
 slow. Maybe worth a look if you run Linux and find lots of performance or=
 stability issues with virtual machines.

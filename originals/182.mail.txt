DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #182 - 29th June 2014

I=E2=80=99m writing this quickly from San Jose airport before flying back=
 to the UK=2C which is why most people will be receiving this issue 8 hour=
s or so later that usual. Lots of content from Velocity and Devopsdays Sil=
icon Valley this week (and probably next when I get more time to find some=
 of the excellent presentations). It=E2=80=99s been great catching up with=
 lots of folks=2C but a big shoutout to the organisers who put on two grea=
t events.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Definitely one of the highlights of Velocity for me=2C this talk aimed to=
 cover everything you need to know to be good at operations. Ambitious=2C=
 entertaining and hugely useful.

Probably a tie for my favourite presentation=2C this next deck covers what=
 the presenter called minimal viable bureaucracy. Lots of personal stories=
 mixed with some wider observations. Lots to learn about organisation desi=
gn in here.

Opsweekly is a tool from Etsy for On call alert classification and reporti=
ng. The README could do with a screenshot but it=E2=80=99s a very interest=
ing idea which brings together all the data from an on-call rota into one=
 place for both personal tracking and bigger picture planning.

Another of the talks from Velocity I found interesting=2C what happens to=
 the infrastructure when a large company buys a smaller one? In this case=
 what and how did Instagrate migrate things over to Facebook?

One of the Velocity ignite talks providing a quickfire argument that you r=
eally really should be caring about security in your development and opera=
tions work.

A nice reminder that devops isn=E2=80=99t about killing off existing posit=
ions but about specialists working together. This post brings up the spect=
re of devops killing off the developer as we know it=2C and them debunks t=
he idea.

Lots of large companies are getting interested in Devops and this next pos=
t should be useful to anyone working in such an enterprise. It collects co=
mmon objections together along with a counter argument.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Given our daily use of version control systems they contain an awful lot o=
f data past just the source code. This tool allows for exporting a git rep=
ository into the solr search engine for data mining.

https://github.com/arafalov/git-to-solr


I=E2=80=99ve mentioned OSv previous as an interesting take on the operatin=
g system=2C but trying it out locally had required a lot of effort. Enter=
 capstan=2C which provides a very nice command line interface to launch OS=
v instances locally on your machine.

Cayley is an open source Graph database. It supports multiple storage back=
ends=2C an HTTP based API as well as a REPL and a built-in query editor an=

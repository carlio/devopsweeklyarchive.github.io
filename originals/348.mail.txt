Post-incident reviews=2C or post-mortems=2C are an important practice for=
 teams running systems in production. Taking this survey=2C part of an aca=
demic research project=2C should help us as a community understand them be=
tter.

Naming is important=2C as it allows us to discuss and share ideas about sp=
ecific concepts. This post looks to define observability=2C and how it dif=
fers from monitoring. A useful distinction.

 an idea of how it works.

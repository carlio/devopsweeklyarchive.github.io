Good writeup from the recent devopsdays Austin, focusing on why culture is=
 important, but just as importantly why it's hard to talk about and addres=
s. I particularly liked the observation that effective culture can be very=
 different between different groups of people.

Interesting take on the Bay area bubble when it comes to the overlap of de=
vops and cloud infrastructures. My experience in the UK at work and at dev=
opsdays is similar, lots of software and infrastructure that runs real com=
panies would be seen as legacy by your average startup.

A nice presentation (with the new Opscode branding) introducing the power=
 of automation. It's a nice short case study of a real world problems bein=
g solved by automating hard or slow parts of a problematic process.

A good post covering pros and cons of microservices=2C good questions to a=
sk when designing systems and the posit that microservices are less about=
 architecture and more an implementation pattern.

An interesting look at Amdahl=E2=80=99s Law=2C the Universal Scaling Law a=
nd what they mean for microservices and for how we=E2=80=99re organsing so=
ftware teams. What is the cost in your systems of maintaining coherence?

A detailed walkthrough of tooling build to automate some of the tasks arou=
nd being on-call. Looking particularly at ways of bringing context along w=
ith alters and to where the operator is interacting with the system.

A post on the importance of design when it comes to the operator experienc=
e. I particularly liked the points about designing data formats or DSLs wh=
ere the operators interact with them directly.

e and more.

A handy comparison between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. I think this miss=
es the point about them being different levels of the stack=2C but that=E2=
=80=99s a common misconception and I think the post makes some good points=
 about opinionated developer tooling.

Container Structure Tests demonstrates a way of writing unit tests for you=

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I=E2=80=99ll group these three new tools together. Dispatch=2C Riff and Nu=
clio are all new serverless platforms targeting Kubernetes (Nuclio can als=
o be run standalone). Lots of projects in this space now and probably more=
 to come. I=E2=80=99d love to see links to experience reports when people=
 have tried them out.

Rubiks is a tool for managing Kubernetes configuration. It provides a Pyth=
on
based internal-DSL for generating the configs and outputs to YAML or JSON=
 for use in other tooling.

Argo is a workflow engine for Kubernetes=2C intended for usecases like con=
tinuous integration and deployment or data processing. It=E2=80=99s implem=
ented as a Kubernetes Custom Resource so tools (like Rubiks above) can be=
 used for managing the configuration.

Dockly is a nice looking command line GUI for Docker. If you want somethin=
g more visual than the CLI=2C but don=E2=80=99t want to leave the terminal=
=2C this looks pretty handy.

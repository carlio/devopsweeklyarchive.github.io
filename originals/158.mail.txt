A nice 4 part series on testing infrastructure as code. The latest post co=

xample integration with TestKitchen and Guard is nice too.

A nice presentation introducing the flapjack monitoring router=2C includin=
g lots of diagrams of how it fits into an existing monitoring stack. I=E2=
=80=99d love to see someone pick up the simple execution engine part of th=
e stack to use with this.

Another blog post series=2C this one up to 6 posts so far covering everyth=
ing that=E2=80=99s going into LXC 1.0. A good getting started guide=2C plu=
s more advanced usage.

An interesting post about the seemingly parallel worlds of devops events a=
nd cloud events. I=E2=80=99m not sure I agree completely=2C as someone who=
 doesn=E2=80=99t self identify with being ops or dev and who was at some o=
f the mentioned events I think the breaking down of barriers makes it hard=
 to tell. Worth reading.

One area where Docker appears to be really useful is disposable test envir=
onments=2C for instance as part of a continuous integration build. This po=
st shows a fairly involved example running a long-running ruby test suite=
=2C including how to configure Jenkins.

We see lots of talk about how Devops is about increasing collaboration=2C=
 but less about how that can be done or what it means for people who are a=
sked to collaborate. This post picks out one important part of that journe=
y=2C empathy=2C both for those you=E2=80=99re collaborating with and ultim=
ately for end users of services.

In my experience most people are using Git for source control=2C partly dr=
iven by the ubiquity of GitHub I=E2=80=99d bet. Facebook chose to use Merc=
urial=2C mainly to work around problems at the huge scale they operate at.=
 This post explains some of the why=2C and also some of the improvements t=
hey made to deal with a huge repository.

A nice post about one approach to setting up connectivity between data two=
 centres=2C in this case using OpenVPN and Vyatta.

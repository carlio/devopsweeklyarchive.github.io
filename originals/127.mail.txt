DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #127 - 9th June 2013

Much of the evidence we have at present for the benefits of Devops is pers=
onal or anecdotal. So it's good to see more surveys and numbers from lots=
 of projects about successes and failures. What I'd love to see however is=
 real hard research - if anyone knows about any interesting ongoing resear=
ch projects do let me know.

If you're at all interested in designing or building distributed systems y=
ou owe it to yourself to read this post. It covers lots of real world expe=

nue reading.

A call to people who feel that Devops is a job title to define what it is=
 that makes that role different, and not just another silo. As well as tha=
t useful call to action, it's a good old rant that I happen to agree with.

I'm a little bit obsessed with both dashboards and with the raspberrypi co=
mputer so this post caught my eye. It shows how to setup a raspberrypi as=
 a wireless dashboard, using the dashing framework. Lots of good examples=
 and the low level instructions. Ripe for someone to script all of this to=
o.

An interesting set of survey results, looking at time spent on various act=
ivities within teams that self describe as taking a Devops approach and th=
ose that don't. Some interesting conclusions and analysis.

A post counter to the argument that Devops as a role is always a bad think=
=2E Personally I don't buy the argument. The claim that "Instead, the mandat=
e should be to focus on people and goals" is to me what management is abou=
t, not a need for a Devops team.

Vagrant now has a book all about it, called Vagrant: Up and Running from O=
'Reilly and written by the author of Vagrant, Mitchell Hashimoto. Especial=
ly if you're helping introduce Vagrant into a new team having an official=
 publication should make this easier.

The topics around Devops seem to be much discussed in the world of Network=
 Engineering at the moment, this post discussing how the traditional netwo=
rk roles might change as more things are automated. I still think the Netw=
ork arena is likely to see some really interesting technology come out in=
 the next year or so.

A nice argument for using configuration management tools to manage your ap=
plication stack. The post then goes on to discuss different ways of using=
 Chef, and is a good starting point for anyone starting to research the pr=
oblem.

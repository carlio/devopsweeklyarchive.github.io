DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #133 - 21st July 2013

It's interesting to see ecosystems emerge around certain tools. Both Chef=
 and Puppet have had an active community for a while not just using the co=
re tool but building it into other products. And lately it feels like Vagr=
ant is now seeing the same thing. More than just plugins we're seeing Vagr=
ant as something to build on - two more examples in the tools section of t=
his issue.

The excellent Monitorama conference is back in Berlin in September 19th an=
d 20th, and the speakers have just been announced. Including the Director=
 for Engineering for Obama for America, the Heroku CTO, the creator of col=
lectd and lots more. $200 for a ticket is a steal. See anyone lucky enough=
 to be going along in Berlin.

A good set of problems that organisations often have with rolling out agil=
e working patterns. The post makes the argument that exactly the same issu=
es will occur when trying to bring a devops mindset to an organisation. Fo=
rewarned is forearmed it would seem.

A nice writeup comparing ITIL and Devops approaches via a nice analogy. Th=
e comparison table in particular could be handy if you=E2=80=99re starting=
 to have this sort of conversation inside an existing ITIL aware organisat=
ion.

An interesting discussion of how risk management and operations management=
 in terms of devops can be seen to work together. Some nice observations a=
bout what devops is as well that I completely agree with.

Nice presentation about the evolution of Chef usage at Prezi as they have=
 grown. Some nice numbers in their, currently 50 internal contributors to=
 the Chef repository out of 60 engineers. Also explains the Chef data mode=
l pretty clearly too.

If you=E2=80=99re in a large organisation then getting managers and collea=
gues to buy-in to devops can be tricky. This excellent presentation from t=
he recent Devopsdays event provides lots of examples and lots of organisat=
ion design patterns to help with the culture shift.

If you=E2=80=99re using or building IaaS products you should real this pos=
t, about the dangers of innovation within silos and the need for standards=
 over a single dominant player in the open source market.

A series of 10 blog posts, taking you through the creation and automating=
 of a local development environment through to managing remote cloud serve=
rs with Chef. Pretty comprehensive learning resource, especially if you=E2=

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

A really interesting online tool for PHP developers and a great idea for e=
veryone else. PuPHPet is a generator for Vagrantfiles, allowing you to tic=
k boxes or specifiy packages or databases in the online form, download a g=
enerated Vagrantfile and get up and running with a pretty comprehensive PH=
P development stack quickly.

Vagrant is growing a really nice ecosystem of tools. Vundler is a Vagrant=
 plugin which makes managing Vagrant plugins easier. It=E2=80=99s modelled=
 on Bundler from Ruby, so you specify the list of plugin dependencies in a=
 text file and use vundler to keep them up to date. Handy for sharing plug=
ins across a team.

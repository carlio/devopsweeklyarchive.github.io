It=E2=80=99s only a few weeks to go before FOSDEM=2C one of my favourite e=
vents of the year. Several days in Brussels=2C a huge range of talks on di=
fferent subjects and lots of interesting folks to catch up with. If you=E2=

I=E2=80=99m a big fan of the food fight show=2C the regular devops podcast=
=2E This post is from one of the hosts=2C encouraging everyone to get in on=
 the community publishing act. I think it=E2=80=99s a pretty good sign tha=
t much of the devops content is community driven.

I=E2=80=99m a big Test Kitchen (an integration testing framework for infra=
structure code) fan but up until now it=E2=80=99s mainly been a tool for t=
he Chef community. With the addition of a basic shell provisioner however=
 it=E2=80=99s now possible to use Test Kitchen everywhere. Here=E2=80=99s=
 a simple hello world example I got running last week.

Cryto and TLS are often complex subjects=2C so it=E2=80=99s good to see po=
sts like this one. Talking specifically about backwards compatibility and=
 how long to support various ciphers for and a bunch of other tests on a w=
ide range of sites.

Ignoring the attempt to create a new buzzword at the end of the post this=
 piece neatly summarises some of the challenges faced in large enterprises=
 when adopting Devops approaches=2C I disagree with small parts but especi=
ally if your experience is in small environments it=E2=80=99s worth a read=
=2E

A nice walkthrough of using Bento to build base boxes for vagrant. The pro=
vided templates in Bento make this incredibly easy to get started with as=
 shown in the tutorial.

Recruiters and buzzwords can be a dangerous mix=2C so I like the idea behi=
nd this presentation - which aims to be a quick introduction to Devops for=
 recruitment folks. Hopefully a few people take note.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

FPM makes building operating system packages easy=2C but you then need a r=
epository to take full advantage of them. PRM aims to make building Debian=
 or RPM repos just as easy=2C and provides a simple S3 compatible sync fac=
ility.

Nugget is a simple HTTP and TCP integration testing tool. Provide it with=
 a configuration file and it will constantly check the given endpoints=2C=
 recording the results in Graphihte via the backstop interface.

Gollector is a nifty looking stats collection daemon which outputs it=E2=
=80=99s collected metrics as JSON. The docs demonstrate integrating this w=
ith Circonus and with a bundled command line app=2C but given the simple J=
SON format you could do anything.

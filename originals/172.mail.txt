DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #172 - 20th April 2014

Lots of content from this ChefConf this week=2C along with a nice run of p=
osts about why having developers focus on customers is probably a good ide=
a=2C even if it takes us away from just writing code all the time. If any=
 readers are going to be at Craft in Budapest this week do say hello while=
 I=E2=80=99m there.

ChefConf
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

A presentation from ChefConf last week all about Berkshelf=2C and in parti=
cular about why strongly opinionated workflow software is probably a good=
 thing.

Another presentation=2C this one focusing on general tips for testing dyna=
mic systems. Presents 7 stages of testing from high level integration test=
ing to unit testing configuration management code and resource starvation.

I=E2=80=99m a huge fan of Test Kitchen=2C especially with the new provisio=
ners making it useful whatever tools you=E2=80=99re using. This presentati=
on is both a good introduction and a look at new and upcoming features.

One more ChefConf presentation. This one shows how to extend the Chef code=
 to add useful features that are likely specific to your infrastructure. E=
xception handling=2C publish/subscribe systems and ohai plugins are all co=
vered.

News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

An interesting post rather cheekily entitled How 'DevOps' is Killing the D=
eveloper. It=E2=80=99s an interesting point but feel it misses the point.=
 A bunch of the comments do a good job of explaining the misunderstanding
http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/04/15/how-devops-is-killing-the-developer/


The above post triggered a couple of worthwhile responses. This next post=
 claims the opposite=2C a shift to thinking about operations is a move tow=
ards thinking about customers rather than just thinking about code - which=
 should be a good thing in nearly every case.

Not exactly a direct follow up to the above post=2C but it highlights the=
 issue that devops really isn=E2=80=99t all about startups as some people=
 appear to think. Great advice for anyone looking to change a large organi=
sation from the inside.

A presentation all about Conway=E2=80=99s Law and continuous delivery. If=
 you=E2=80=99re only aware of Conway=E2=80=99s Law in passing this is a go=
od introduction=2C and mapping it to the organisational change required fo=
r continuous delivery to work is a nice idea.

http://www.slideshare.net/allankellynet/conways-law-continuous-delivery


More and more of the technical challenges larger organisations are facing=
 are routed in distributed systems=2C so it=E2=80=99s worthwhile being fam=
iliar with the background=2C terminology and past work. This online book a=
ims to be an approachable introduction to the subject.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Microsoft continue a good run of form by shipping a Vagrant provider for A=

ows host.

The Chef Development Kit was announced at ChefConf and provides a nice opi=
nionated development environment for Chef. This should lower the barrier t=
o entry=2C especially for those new to Chef and especially to Ruby.

An interesting project announced at the recent RedHat Summit=2C Atomic is=

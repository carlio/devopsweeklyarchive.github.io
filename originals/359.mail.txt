Free Webinar: How BI & Data Science Gets Results
November 16=2C Online

Statistical/data science models can now run on Hadoop in a much more cost-=
effective manner than a few years ago. This results in fostering the conve=
rgence of traditional BI and Data Science disciplines (machine learning=2C=
 artificial intelligence... etc). Join the discussion with an incredible p=
anel including ODPi=2C 4C Decision=2C ZEPL=2C and Pivotal=2C as we'll shar=
e how this phenomenon is going to impact the Hadoop standard.

n this case Airbnb. Honesty about problems and lots of good advice for add=
ressing them.

CloudFormation templates can become unwieldy quickly so the testing workfl=
ow this post suggests should be useful. It combines guard and a cloudforma=
tion validator into a new guard plugin.

The Go continuous delivery platform is going to be released as open source=
=2E It=E2=80=99s available free now=2C with the source code available shortl=
y. Go is similar to popular continuous integration tools but with a strong=
 focus on building pipelines. Will be interesting to see if this spurs wid=
er adoption.

Working out ways of writing more testable code is a big part of adopting a=
n infrastructure as code approach in my view. This post is a good example=
=2C demonstrating how to test custom facts in puppet=2C but the approach t=
aken is general to anything you want to test.

Sorry about the ads on this next post but it=E2=80=99s an interesting read=
=2E It boldly proclaims devops as being the biggest change in IT since outso=
urcing. It=E2=80=99s interesting to read opinion pieces aimed more at ente=
rprise CIOs and viewing devops through the perspective of organisational c=
hange.

Another similar example=2C with a short case study of GE moving in parts a=
way from specialists towards more full stack engineers. For people in very=
 large organisations cases studies like this should help with convincing t=
he boss.

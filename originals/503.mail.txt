DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #503 - 16th August 2020

I always like seeing what themes emerge from the week's content. This week=
 several posts on networking=2C query languages and the similarities and d=
ifferences (in approach and provided services) between the major cloud pro=
viders.

News

eBPF aims to make the Linux kernel programmable=2C without the need to loa=
d kernel modules or compile custom kernels. This new site is a great intro=
duction and links to several interesting projects utilising eBPF.

A post both on OSPF datacenter-scale networking=2C and on the risks of sil=
os when choosing technology.

The differences in approach between the major clouds are interesting to co=
nsider=2C especially if you=E2=80=99re most familiar with one of them. Thi=
s post looks at various network routing and load balancing options.

I=E2=80=99ve always liked OpenResty=2C which is an Nginx variant with buil=
t-in support for Lua scripting. This post is a nice introduction and a goo=
d example of dynamic configuration.

Nearly everyone will have used SQL for some database work at some point. T=
his post takes a critical look at the language and points out some issues=
=2C and proposes some improvements.

Another post on a query language. PromQL=2C from Prometheus=2C is increasi=
ngly used in other tools. In the absence of a proper specification=2C some=
 efforts are underway to provide a correctness testing tool.

endors


I like finding relevant research topics for this newsletter=2C for the poi=
nts made in this article about the relevance of research to IT practitione=
rs. Some good pointers to recent security=2C privacy and cloud research to=
pics.

Tools

Fregot is a powerful repl for working with Rego=2C the Open Policy Agent p=
olicy language. It provides useful error messages and testing tools for it=
erating on policies.

READMEs and documentation are not part of container images (unfortunately)=
=2C but registries typically support documentation against repositories. T=
his tool helps with synchronisation content for Docker Hub=2C Quay and Har=
bor registries.

Both AWS and Azure have lots of overlapping services=2C but if you know on=
e but are using the other how can you navigate the large service catalog?=
 A2a provides a simple tool to help. GCP support planned too.

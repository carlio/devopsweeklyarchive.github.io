I=E2=80=99ve made similar arguments before=2C but this post does a great j=
ob of reminding folks that most system administrators have been programmer=
s for a while=2C and similar roles will likely involve more code not less=
 over time

A little artificial=2C but a well reasoned argument for why adopting conta=
iners is the right approach to building software today=2C at least from th=
e developers point of view.

ClusterHQ are conducting a survey into container adoption. Surveys are nea=
rly always more useful the wider the group of people who complete them - c=
ontainer surveys in particular tend to skew towards people using container=
s in my experience. Please take a moment and fill it it.

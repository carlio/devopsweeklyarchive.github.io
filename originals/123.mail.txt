DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #123 - 12th May 2013

A glut of tools this week covering testing utilities, security configurati=
ons, monitoring dashboards and cloud management tools. Also a special ment=
ion for Test Kitchen which features in a few articles this week. With the=
 merging of the 1.0 branch this is worth looking at now if you're a Chef u=
ser or a particularly enthusiastic Puppet user with Puppet support coming=
 soon. It's a great example of open source in action.

Devops is often talked about in terms of bringing development best practic=
e to infrastructure. This screencast covers using Chef, Berkshelf, Vagrant=
 and Test Kitchen to do test driven development for a simple chef cookbook=

Assuming the above article has sold you on using Test Kitchen you might be=
 thinking about another good development practice - continuous integration=
=2E This next post covers setting Test Kitchen up with Jenkins to run your t=
ests after each commit.

Interesting article on the move towards distributed application design as=
 more and more apps move to IaaS or PaaS platforms. Provides a set of good=
 questions to ask yourself as well as a worked example of a image resizing=
 service.

O'Reilly continue with releasing free short ebooks (you just need to provi=
de name and email address), this one is on The Human Side of Postmortems -=
 Managing Stress and Cognitive Biases. Looks excellent.

Good detailed writeup of moving a development environment to one using Vag=
rant. Some practical discussion of issues and trade-offs like whether to b=
uild custom boxes and how to manage many services during development.

Especially in the Ruby world it's becoming quite common to bundle the runt=
ime with the application. This post covers how to do that with JRuby and B=
undler using jruby-complete. This makes even more sense when shipping to J=
ava environments that are used to Jar and War based deployments.

I don't think I've included a "what is devops" post for a while and I do l=
ike finding new ones. I think it's interesting seeing how people come to d=
evops and how the attempts to define things change over time.

Tools

If you're using Puppet and Red Hat then you need this module. It implement=
s the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Security Configuration Benchmark.=
 This makes lots of low level config changes which should improve the secu=
rity of a base image.

Performance testing web applications often ignores the impact of the clien=
t, or at least doesn't involve this in automated testing. wbench aims to f=
ix that, providing a command line tool that interacts with Chrome and prov=
ides nice and useful output regarding browser performance.

https://github.com/desktoppr/wbench


Test Kitchen is fast becoming an essential tool for testing configuration=
 management code. Guard Kitchen integrates Test Kitchen with Guard, which=
 will automatically run your tests when things change.

If you're building Ruby applications you have to work quite hard to build=
 good logging into applications. Logging4hackers is a project to improve t=
hat, the README has lots of good patterns and sensible complaints about cu=
rrent approaches.

Dusk is another dashboard for Graphite. This one is based on the cubism.js=
 library and aims to highlight hotspots across a cluster.

Overmind is an attempt to build a unified interface to various cloud provi=
ders. It exposes a RESTful API built on top of libcloud and currently supp=
orts EC2 and Rackspace.

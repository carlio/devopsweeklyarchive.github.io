 week we have everything from IT Service Management and Auditing to intere=
sting new tools or arguments that we=E2=80=99re doing system integration w=

A pretty good argument that integrating systems via discrete APIs is an=
 =E2=80=9Cunsalvageable anachronism=E2=80=9C when it comes to the complexi=
ty of today's distributed systems. Worth reading for anyone building large=
 systems.

An interested and detailed look at more traditional IT service management=
 and devops. I don=E2=80=99t agree with a bunch of points here (I don=E2=
=80=99t think they are opposing forces) but the post makes a few good poin=
ts.

Kibana-rack embeds the Kibana ElasticSearch interface into a Rack middlewa=
re=2C making running it alongside existing ruby apps simpler. The example=
 showing authentication integration with Devise shows why this might be a=
 good idea for some.

An interesting curated set of Go libraries for common operations and autom=
ation tasks. Everything from DNS and consensus protocols to load testing a=
nd metrics collection.

This packer provisioner allows for running provisioning command on the hos=
t rather than the new machine being built. I can imagine a few uses for th=
is=2C from black box testing to recording the results of packer builds.

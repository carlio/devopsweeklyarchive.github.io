mages=2C managing various flavours of service mesh and testing CloudFormat=
ion templates.

A post (from a certain viewpoint) about some of the downsides of adopting=
 specific devops practices. I think the first point about on-call is a cas=

 but because they were not part of the team it was easier to ignore.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #178 - 1st June 2014

I occasionally get emails asking how to get something featured in Devops W=
eekly. It comes down to two things=2C either I find useful content or tool=
s while I=E2=80=99m reading the internet that week=2C or people send me li=
nks that I think are interesting. So if you come across something or write=
 something that you think is interesting do send me an email or drop me a=
 line at @garethr on twitter.

A good post comparing and contrasting ITIL with aspects of devops. It focu=
ses on the transition phase and discusses this in light of continuous deli=
very. The post also nicely packages this up in a design that tries to comb=
ine the best of both worlds. A good reminder ITIL is a framework too.

Some interesting research on on-call and sleep patterns=2C done not in a l=
ab but based on the habits and actual alerts at Etsy. The opsweekly idea m=
entioned also sounds a good way to optimise alerts and especially which on=
e=E2=80=99s really need to page someone out-of-hours.

Another response to questions about devops suitability for larger=2C more=
 traditional=2C organisations. Some interesting points and references to e=
xamples. The more high level examples like this the easier it is to have c=
onversations about devops practices in my experience.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #108 - 27th January 2013

I'm really looking forward to the Belgium roadtrip this week. Puppetcamp,=
 FOSDEM and the monitoringlove hack day one after the other. If anyone is=
 going to be around Ghent, Brussels or Antwerp and wants to meet up let me=
 know. I'll try and get next weeks issue out when I can, but it will rely=
 on me finding an internet connection so might be a little delayed.

Ever been putting together a custom dashboard and needed a handy javascrip=
t library to help with the graphs, charts and other visualisations? This p=
age collects a rather large number of tools together in one place, along w=
ith a hand sample image. No excuses for dashboards not being pretty.

Good in-depth walkthrough of building a Jenkins pipeline to build vagrant=
 boxes with veewee and upload them to S3. Covers all the pitfalls and prov=
ides simple instructions. A useful guide if you're doing something similar=

Inspired by a recent devopsdays event someone put together a reading list=
 of devops related books. Only one overly technical book too, with lots ab=
out process and organisation change.

Lots of good talk about the role of being on-call recently. This blog post=
 describes how a small startup have evolved their on-call rota and how the=
y are now involving operations, developers and soon designers in the respo=
nse.

Good talk from the recent devopsdays conference by Dave Zwieback all about=
 hiring people into roles in a devops minded organisation.

Interesting post about the difference between composable and contextual wa=
ys of extending tools. Some good points for anyone writing tools with APIs=
 or wanting their tools to be extended, and for anyone who hates Maven and=
 wonders why.

Jobs
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Stripe is building next-generation infrastructure for online payments. We'=
re hiring engineers with operations experience to take our systems to the=
 next level of scalability and reliability. If you love building high thro=
ughput, chaos monkey-proof systems; if you've built and maintained large s=
oftware projects before; and if taking updates is a cathartic experience,=
 then you should do-release-upgrade to Stripe. To apply, send an email to=
 jobs+devops-weekly@stripe.com with a description of your experience, rele=
vant online handles, and anything else that would be useful for us to know=

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Ledbetter is a relatively simple nagios to graphite integration. It takes=
 the state of various checks and servicegroups in nagios and exports that=
 data to graphite with a script you can run on a cron.

I like open source projects that make it clear what license they are relea=
sed under. But copying a file around into your repo is easy to forget to d=
o. Lice solves that problem nicely with a command line tool that knows abo=
ut lots of popular licenses.

Ybot is a hubot inspired chat bot which aims to be a platform for exposing=
 data and commands in a central manner. It's written in Erlang, but you ca=
n extend it with scripts in various languages including ruby, python, shel=
l and perl.

Ironfan is a Chef orchestration layer, providing lots of tools and knife e=
xtensions for managing a fleet of machines. What caught my eye this week w=
as the walkthrough tool, which allows for using the chef DSL to define a s=
et of virtual machines.

Shameless promotion of something I've been hacking on, very similar to the=
 above ironfan example. A puppet module allowing for defining a set of vir=
tual machines and load balancers from different cloud providers in the pup=
pet DSL, and using an idempotent puppet run to ensure that they exist.

An interesting post on the evolving role of the network engineer. Points a=
bout moving away from a fixation on individual hardware devices to a bigge=
r picture view=2C and comparisons with the evolution of systems administra=
tion over the past few years.

A great post looking at the basics of value-stream-mapping for organising=
 teams=2C and focusing on minimising dependencies with some great real-wor=
ld examples.

An interesting approach to managing versioned dependencies in Terraform=2C=
 by introducing a Terrafile which defines all the dependencies in one plac=
e.

An interesting analogy=2C comparing flying by instrument to how infrastruc=
ture monitoring works at scale=2C and how reacting to individual stimuli w=
ithout a broader context can be dangerous.

A detailed walkthrough of using BOSH and concourse as a deployment pipelin=
e for infrastructure=2C focusing specifically on the problem of secrets ma=
nagement (and using Vault to solve it).

A detailed look at what it takes to write a good status update. Specific e=
xamples and guidance for those times when you need to let people know some=
thing if broken.

Building infrastructure out of many small open source parts can be tricky=
=2C as the surface area for integration can be under defined. Here=E2=80=
=99s a good example in why Kubernetes doesn=E2=80=99t use Docker=E2=80=99s=
 libnetwork.

An interesting post on how to interview for engineers to work on cloud bas=
ed systems. It=E2=80=99s biased towards Amazon terminology and practice=2C=
 but containers some good advice for other stacks too.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

ShellCheck is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. As well as providi=
ng hints on syntax it can also pick up on unused variables and in some cas=
es suggest corrections for typos.

Building on ShellCheck=2C Hadolint is a linter for Dockerfiles. As well as=
 providing information based on Docker published guidelines it also picks=
 up on issues with shell code using in RUN directives.

If you=E2=80=99re already familiar with Docker=2C but interested in runc=
=2C then the riddler tool is likely useful. It can inspect a running docke=
r container and automatically generate the config and runtime files requir=
ed to start the same container under runc.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Managing local machines with Vagrantfiles has lots of advantages=2C but wh=

Terraform is a tool aimed at giving you a single view of your entire infra=
structure in code. Describe instances and supporting services (like DNS) v=
ia a domain specific language and use the command line tool to launch acro=
ss multiple infrastructure providers.

Consul is an orchestration mechanism with fault-tolerance based on the gos=
sip protocol and a key/value store that is eventually consistent. Hiera-co=
nsul will allow hiera to write to the k/v store for metadata centralisatio=
n and harmonisation.

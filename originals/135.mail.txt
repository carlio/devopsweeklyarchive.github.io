DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #135 - 4th August 2013

A bunch of interesting technology posts and tutorials this week along with=
 a scattering of process and business content. In the tools section Minion=
 (from Mozilla) and Wraith (from the BBC) are interesting new open source=
 releases, it=E2=80=99s nice to see larger companies open sourcing quite s=
ubstantial tools like these recently.

Nice setup which can launch the required project dependencies when you cd=
 into a directory. The example uses docker, but the secret sauce is the ex=
cellent Autoenv.

Good video discussion about enabling infrastructure optimisation and speed=
ing up organisations. Focuses on the benefits of simplicity and the import=
ance of applying that to organisations as well as IT systems.

nfrastructure-in-order-to-do-devops-goodness/


A nice discussion of the composable vs contextual argument applied to proc=
esses. Comparing Six-Sigma, ITIL, RUP, Scrum and the like as contextual vs=
 composable patterns like version control, development environment automat=
ion and standups.

Nice writeup of how Etsy rollout infrastructure changes with Chef to about=
 1000 nodes. Focuses on a continuous delivery pipeline and discusses the s=
pecific tools that make it safe for 30 or more people to make very frequen=
t changes.

Where to start learning about systems administration and operations? This=
 report card provides 32 questions you can ask to access the maturity of y=
our organisation, along with an essay about each one.

An interesting interview about devops adoptions, focused on how things are=
 changing in the largest traditional enterprises. It=E2=80=99s still incre=
dibly interesting to me that the same thing is being discussed from startu=
ps to oil companies.

CoreOS is describing itself as a new way to think about servers, or as Lin=
ux for the container world. Simply put it=E2=80=99s a very minimal locked=
 down distro which integrates with docker and provides some useful distrib=
uted primitives. Baking raft based consensus into the OS is probably the t=
hing that got my attention the most.

A pretty comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough of automatically adding mo=
nitoring checks in Icinga to nodes managed by Puppet. Stored configs can b=
e tricky so having a detailed tutorial could be handy.

Automating testing of CSS is hard and little done outside syntax checking.=
 Which makes wraith particularly interesting. It automates before and afte=
r screenshots, and creates a diff image which highlights changes. It=E2=80=
=99s intended to make testing across many devices and resolutions much fas=
ter.

Minion is a newish security testing framework. It provides the glue which=
 ties together a number of testing tools (currently skipfish, nmap and owa=
sp zap) to try and make things more visible across a development team.

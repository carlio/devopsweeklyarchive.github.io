DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #257 - 6th December 2015

I spent some time this week at the excellent ThingMonk IoT conference (tha=
nks Fintan and James). One of the things that struck me was the overlap wi=
th the topics normally covered in this newsletter - especially around metr=
ics and monitoring=2C but also some interesting new twists - like physical=
 security=2C distributed device management and more focus on power. If any=
one comes across=2C or is working on=2C writing on IoT system administrati=
on do drop me a line.

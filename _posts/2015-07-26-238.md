With the Open Container Project, and now the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, it’s interesting to see a move towards shared ownership, and the potential for open standards, play out for containers. I’d love to read more peoples opinions on how all of that will play out.

The 2015 State of Devops report has been published (disclaimer - by my employer Puppet Labs), with lots of solid data and analysis on the impact devops in organisations. Particularly useful for convincing management colleagues of the value of embracing devops ideas.

Kubernetes is being adopted as a core part of a number of modern infrastructure platforms, so the release of 1.0 is noteworthy. It will be interesting to see what else comes from the newly announced Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Some interesting observations and advice for people getting started with devops. It’s interesting how this topics has evolved over the last several years for different people getting interested now.

An interesting example of using Docker and Nix together. Using Nix to build the container and then wrapping it with a scratch container so Docker can run  it.

A nice step back from the higher level container tools to introduce chroot and cgroups in the context of Docker. A useful quick introduction.

A reminder, with good data, that exposing unsecured databases to the internet is never a good idea. Worth being reminded of the next time you try any software out.

Vulnerability data is often messier that you might realise. A few interesting posts analysing the central CVE database, looking at quality and growth. Lots of research opportunities here.

Tools
=====

Kusk is a new Kubernetes ingress controller that routes requests based on an OpenAPI specification, reducing repetition.

A new Kubernetes autoscaling service, Karpenter observes the aggregate resource requests of unscheduled pods and makes decisions to launch and terminate nodes to minimize scheduling latencies and infrastructure cost.

Hubris is a lightweight, memory-protected, message-passing kernel for deeply embedded systems. An interesting vision for open source low level compute.

Acra is a database security suite. It provides a proxy with field-level encryption, search through encrypted data, SQL injections prevention, intrusion detection, honeypots and more for a variety of SQL and NoSQL databases.

I’m a big fan of higher level domain-specific tools that focus on specific ecosystems. Kuby is a new Kubernetes deployment tool that’s highly optimised for Ruby on Rails.

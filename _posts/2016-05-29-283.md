Serverlessconf kicked off a bunch of interesting conversations on the internet this week about the serverless architectural style. I just wanted to say thanks to the many folks who contributed to that discussion with a focus on what it means for operations. Lets try and avoid the hyperbole and slipping into well-trodden silos.

Blue Ocean is the codename for a brand new user interface to Jenkins, centered around the concept of a pipeline. Jenkins is powerful and widely deployed, but this plugin aims to provide a modern user experience around specific usages.

Events
======

I’m super excited that DevOps Enterprise Summit is coming to London on June 30th and July 1st. The US editions have provided great examples of devops practices being applied in traditional organisations, and with speakers from Hiscox, SAP, ING, Lego and more it should be another great event.

Tools
=====

For all the simplicity in the basic Dockerfile, following the current best practice can be tricky. Dockerize Me provides an opinionated, wizard-like, approach to building Docker images.

Rocker is another Docker build tool, in this case one which adds some new features to the standard Dockerfile - including tagging and pushing from within the file, mounting build-time volumes and attaching to the build process part way through to aid debugging.

We often talk about the importance of holding a learning review or blameless postmortem after an incident, but how do you track those over time? Enter Morgue. A simple web application, plus some interesting Jira and IRC integration.

If you run SSH on a non-standard port you still run the risk of people discovering that port. So why not change the port every 30s and use TOTP codes to discover it?

Managing the configuration of a complex piece of software can too easily fall back into manual, error prone practices. Monkey Ops is an application which aims to ensure your OpenShift setup is robust by finding and finding resources like Pods or DeploymentConfigs and randomly terminating them.

Tools
=====

vcluster creates fully functional virtual Kubernetes clusters running inside a namespace of an underlying Kubenretes cluster. It's cheaper than creating separate clusters and it offers better multi-tenancy and isolation than regular namespaces.

Lima is a brand new tool for anyone on a Mac wanting to run Linux instances that come pre-configured with containerd for running containers.

eBPF on Windows. Lots of interesting things are being built on top of eBPF in the Linux kernel. The idea of eBPF implementations in other operating systems and even user space programmes is certainly interesting.

Do you find yourself writing bash scripts but wish you could write JavaScript instead? Zx provides some nice utilities and removes the need for users to be node or npm experts.

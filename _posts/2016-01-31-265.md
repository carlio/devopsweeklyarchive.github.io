An excellent explanation of why continuous deployment matters to business. Includes well reasoned lists for advantages for both developers and business folks, ideal if you’re trying to convince your organisation to adopt.

An excellent slide deck and video from a talk from the recent Scale14x conference, all about adopting service discovery, and the various problems encountered and overcome as they scaled usage.

I’ve spoken previously about the importance of standards emerging, in particular around monitoring. So OpenTracing looks like a great endeavour, aiming to offer consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral APIs for popular tracing platforms.

There has been some conversations about what debugging might look like for Unikernel based systems recently. This post takes a deep dive into profiling Mirage, both as a unix binary using standard tools and a proof-of-concept flame graph for MIrage running on Xen.

A nice early experience report of running Kubernetes in production. Some points about the use of environments and namespaces, monitoring and deployment workflows.

FOSDEM spans two days, at least 20 tracks and a huge number of talks so consider this just a sample, but these raw notes give you a good idea of how some of the talks went this year.

Managing public keys in a large infrastructure is a subtle problem, and this post does a good job of asking and answering some of the common questions.

I’m not sold on the term microcontainer, but this post is a good introduction to the use and advantages of smaller base operating system images like Alpine for Docker containers.

An exploration of what an end-to-end pipeline might look like for a docker based workflow. Covering everything from running tests to static analysis, a good reference for related tools.

Tools
=====

Builds servers can become complex quickly, sometimes because the problem you’re trying to solve is itself complicated. But if you have highly opinionated (git and GitHub only) and simpler CI requirements then Surf might be worth a look.

Goad is a nice demonstration of building a useful tool using Apache Lambda. It’s a Go based distributed load testing tool that takes advantage of the serverless architecture of Lambda to spin up on demand.

Keeping up with what service is running on what port is always tricky, and the commands to get the information tend to be somewhat cryptic. Enter whatportis, a simple interface for getting the ports in use by a service, or the service running on a specified port.

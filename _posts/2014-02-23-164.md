News

The post I included about Nagios last week caused quite a good debate on the internet somewhere. Here’s a good response about why you might be best sticking with Nagios after all.

Lots of conversations around devops concern how to break down organisational silos. This post delves nicely into why they exist.

LXC, the Linux Containers project, has shipped a 1.0 release, which comes with 5 years of long term support and a slew of new features. From the maintainers point of which this is now considered stable for production.

Running your application inside a container is all the rage at the moment. But as this post points out, if you’re using docker you’re doing a lot more than that - you’re running a minimal OS, but without various expected services like syslog, cron, ssh, etc.

An interesting attempt to build an online knowledge base for software configuration management, infrastructure orchestration and devops. The content is on GitHub so pull requested accepted.

A common pattern in organisations embracing devops is a move towards self-service. This post brings up a bit of history and outlines some of the advantages of a self-service operating model.

I wrote a post last week about the buy vs build quandary when it comes to monitoring systems. This was based on conversations at the recent London Devops meetup. I’d like to see more conversations around cost and business topics as they apply to development and operations.

Tools
====

Graylog2, the data analytics and log processing app has a new version out with a whole raft of new features. Powerful alerting, much simpler deployment, comprehensive API, lovely looking interface. Lots of big screenshots on the site should give you an idea.

Two of my favourite things combined into one. This Vagrant plugin makes it trivial to add serverspec tests to provisioning runs. Hugely useful if you’re sharing Vagrantfiles, you can now provide tests to check that everything works.

Gulp is a streaming build system that combines a few nice features from other software components into one. Setup tasks you can run from the command line, or which run automatically when files change. The provided sample config should give you the idea.

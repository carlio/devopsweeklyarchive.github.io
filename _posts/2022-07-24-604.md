News
====

High quality learning material is hugely useful given the large number of technologies relevant to modern software development and operations. This set of crash course posts on Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and Terraform look super useful for anyone just getting started.

What’s the maximum size of a DNS response? If you thought the answer would be straightforward you’ve not dealt with DNS enough.

Synchronisation in real-world distributed systems is a surprisingly complex problem. This post looks at an example, and how lightweight formal methods can be used to ensure correctness.

An in-depth look at AzOps, a highly integrated approach to managing Azure infrastructure with out-of-the-box pipelines and tooling built-in. Includes a good list pros and cons.

Carbon is an experimental successor language to C++. Basically designed for anyone who can’t just move to Rust or other languages. Carbon is to C++ what TypeScript is to JavaScript.

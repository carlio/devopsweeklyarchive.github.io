Most software teams are regularly making decisions about whether to use something off-the-shelf or build something from scratch. This post is a nice story about just such a case, with the advice to never write your own database.

A good walkthrough of how to change the deployment model rather than the development model when migrating older technologies. In this case using Docker to package Fortran applications.

An experience report of 6 months using a serverless environment, going from using the basics to adopting frameworks and other associated AWS services.

A few examples of how to build Docker images when you need to access private Git repositories.

A good tale of reassessing a previous configuration change in light of improvements to the underlying technology. In this case a sizable reduction in CPU usage by removing out of band garbage collector.

Determining the suitability of your Kubernetes cluster for stateful workloads requires some knowledge of the system. Litmus provides a cucumber-based testing tool and chaos engineering toolkit for solving this problem.

An excellent talk from RSA on the intersection of governance, risk and compliance with devops practices.

Conftest, the Open Policy Agent based tool for testing infrastructure as code, now has a handy plugin model. This post covers a few examples, for Kubernetes and AWS, and explains how to build your own.

An interesting set of examples and exercises around Kubernetes security, looking at built-in Kubernetes capabilities.

Another RSA talk, this one looking at the potential for attackers who know how Kubernetes works under-the-hood. Some pretty nefarious ideas demonstrated well.

One of the advantages of Kubernetes as a platform is itâ€™s extensibility. This post looks at two mechanisms for this; adding your own scheduler and creating an an operator.

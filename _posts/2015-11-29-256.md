A reminder that, if you work for a company, you should practice good systems administration practices for end user devices like laptops too. Having a standard build for your organisation is a great topic I’d like to see more written on.

My talk from the recent DockerCon EU event, all about the metadata capabilities of container runtimes, and how Docker Labels in particular could be used to expose an API for containers.

A nice write-up of the Facebook paper Moving fast with software verification. The concept of a pipeline for software delivery is widespread, but I’m not sure we collectively have a set of well defined best practices yet. More research please.

An excellent talk entitled “Tools, Culture and Aesthetics – The Art of DevOps”, focusing squarely on the culture aspects of devops and in particular how to build that culture in traditional organisations.

A good outsider's perspective on what is a unikernel. Lots of links to other references and a good starting point if you’ve heard the term but aren’t sure what the fuss is about.

Interesting approach to testing network connectivity. A simple tool and YAML file configuration, but with the ability to autogenerate those configs from packet sniffing, Django config files and more.

Perl was the system administrators language of choice several years ago, and Perl 6 is finally here. This excellent introduction goes through the language features, including installation and the new gradual type system.

Sup describes itself as “make for network servers”. It allows you to describe a set of hosts and commands, and provides a simple CLI to interact with them. Similar to Fabric in Python, but in this case written in Go with a YAML configuration file.

The King’s Hand is a tool for organizing ad-hoc scripts written in Go. It provides a simple discovery mechanism and a way of loading arbitrary go binaries into the kh tool.

Definitely a theme of simplicity/complexity in a few posts this week, from considering testing in production to applying cynefin to devops to discussions of private cloud.

News
====

It’s easy to talk about testing in production, but what does that look like for complex real-world systems? This post has lots of details around stateless systems.

A very nice description of the tradeoffs we make when we build large systems out of many small microservices.

Related to the above discussion of simple, this post looks at apply the cynefin framework to operations work. Good discussions of environment management, deployment, chatops and leadership.

The Kubernetes project is increasingly prevalent. The project journey report therefore makes interesting reading, looking at where contributions come from in terms of companies, geographies, individuals and more.

A writeup from last weeks Chaos Conf in San Francisco. Lots of links and descriptions of talks. I particularly liked the chaos experiments for people systems discussion.

Linux capabilities provide a wealth of low-level functionality that’s not yet well exposed in easy-to-use abstractions. This post delves into the details which might get you thinking about use cases.

A good overview of the recent State of Devops report results, with a focus on some of the data regarding devops security practices.

70% of IT spend is still on premise. This presentation looks at why, exploring the sunk cost fallacy, efficiencies of public cloud and why you might not want a private cloud after all.

As cloud services have become more widely adopted, the economics of how things are priced has become more interesting, and more immediate. This experience report looks at one example, though it’s also interesting to think about what role familiarity with specific architectures plays in cost optimisation.

Terminology and definitions, especially around new categories, tends to require lots of back and forth and building agreement. This post takes a run at defining the properties of observability systems around addressing unknown-unknowns.

A presentation with lots of diagrams, explaining a CI/CD process designed for a large organisation. Good discussion of some of the design decisions, and always nice to see rich examples.

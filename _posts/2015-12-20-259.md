Structured logging is the idea that log messages should be well structured for both human and machine parsing, rather than a long line requiring a sprinkle of regular expressions. This post is an excellent introduction to the idea, along with lots of examples.

A great post on various operational anti-patterns when using containers. Neglecting management-over-time and forgetting the hard-won wisdom of many init scripts in favour of some bash. Good examples too of application patterns to address some of these issues.

A somewhat shameless inclusion of some recent work I’ve been doing around using Puppet to manage Pods, Services, ReplicationControllers, etc. in Kubernetes. If anyone has any feedback or ideas around this do let me know.

Recent versions of the Puppet language support iteration and a few syntactic tricks which make various usecases involving using external data to define resources easier. This post shows a few examples.

An overview of a particular infrastructure architecture using Docker, Kubernetes and Yesod (a Haskell based web framework) - showing examples of configuration and talking about issues found.

An interesting argument for using microservices even in a small team, focused on the visibility benefits provided by a highly granular architecture.

A nice post on a reasonably low-dependency way of building out graphs and dashboards on your own infrastructure. A nice reminder that higher-level or powerful tools aren’t always the answer for personal projects.

A very-much business focused article about why exploring Devops is a good idea, and some observations about how adoption often takes place.

A good write-up from a recent container-centric meetup, describing three interesting talks on nulecule (a container packaging/distribution format), using docker and serverspec for infrastructure testing and a talk on using ceph to provide container storage.

Another post extolling the benefits of structure logging, and looking at how that structured data can then be used by Elasticsearch and pushed into Graphite by Logstash.

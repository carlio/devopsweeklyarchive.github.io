A good post with a great description of why moving on-call responsibility to application teams makes sense in the case of fast moving applications and some thoughtful comments on the emerging SRE role.

A solid argument that both the ITSM and Devops communities are not talking enough about customers. More discussion about post-devops service management please.

Although the focus is on clojure examples, this post does a good job of describing the multi-dimensional aspects of application configuration - looking at compile time vs runtime, configuration changes after boot and more.

One interesting aspect of serverless architectures is the sheer number of functions you may be managing. Which makes areas like centralised logging and management interesting, emerging, topics.

For lots of people adopting infrastructure as code they may be used to programming and scripting, but maybe not some practices like unit testing or software quality metrics. This post is a good starting place for anyone coming to Chef or Ruby based environments.

Lots of tools this week, and only a few posts, plus a few slide decks from last weeks QCon event in London. I’ve spotted lots of conversations recently about the cross-over (or not) between Serverless and the Cloud Native communities, if you spot any good posts please point me in their direction.

Two related posts on the relationship between serverless and Kubernetes that position them at different parts of the same stack.

eBPF is a Linux Kernel level observability feature that’s seeing more widespread adoption as tools are built atop it. The post explains what it is and contains some sample eBPF programs.

An interesting post on the relationship between increasing the rate of change with more deployments, and the resulting stability of the system. The post explores what it actually takes to improve stability without sacrificing speed.

A little bit of a rant, but this post looks at the perils of IAM, and identity provision in general, to lock you in to specific tools or services.

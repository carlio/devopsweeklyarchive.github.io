News
====

A post on optimising a CI build pipeline based on Bazel, looking at the challenge introduced by immutable infrastructure and the benefits of persistent caching.

A useful presentation on what we mean by platform, and how platforms and platform teams can reduce the cognitive burden on development teams.

An interesting set of posts on alternatives to writing Kubernetes configuration in YAML files. The same simple example in JSON, C#, F#, Terraform, Java and Python so far.

A neat visualisation of some of the things that someone wanting to move into system administration would likely want to learn. It does however focus squarely on the tools rather than wider devops issues.

A two part migration story, moving from EC2 on AWS, to Kubernetes on Google Cloud. Details of data, databases, moving from AWS ALB to Istio and more.

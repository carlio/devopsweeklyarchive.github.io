A thought-provoking piece that makes the argument that it might be too easy to rebrand operations and SRE without actually changing anything. Lots of good observations here.

A great presentation (with notes) all about being on-call, service-level objectives, determining failure and more.

I’ve picked up on lots of conversations of late about right-sized services over microservices. Like with most architecture conversations there are rarely absolute solutions as much as tradeoffs to understand.

A long post that touches on the importance of end-to-end observability as systems grow, and why focusing on the critical path is a good idea for scaling development practices.

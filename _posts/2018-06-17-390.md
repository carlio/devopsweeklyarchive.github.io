A fair bit of Docker content this week, mainly with it being DockerCon rather than because I happen to work there hopefully. But some other good posts on the state of systems programming languages, comparisons of managed Kubernetes services and talk of cloud vs private costs.

News
====

A series of blog posts on using Jenkins and Docker to build a CI pipeline, updated from two years ago. The overview of changes in the respective tools over the last 24 months in particular is super interesting.

A great post on exploring emerging systems languages, including Pony, Reason, Nim and Rust. The attempts to implement the same application in each are enlightening.

Some interesting stats about the adoption of Docker containers over 10,000 companies and 700 million containers. Seeing the data over the last 4 years is interesting too.

A nice review of the recent Distributed Systems Availability:A Guide To Building Robust Systems short book.

A useful side-by-side comparison of the main public cloud Kubernetes services (GKE, AKS and EKS). Looking at onboarding, availability, add-ons and more.

A look at building your own continuous integration system from a custom web frontend, nomad, docker and the pants build system.

A useful reminder that although comparisons of cloud vs private costs can be useful, a straight focus on like-for-like cost will likely see you missing the benefits of cloud adoption.

Bias warning as I worked on this, but Docker Application Packages are work talking a look at if youâ€™re a regular Compose user. They allow for sharing Compose-based applications via any image registry (including Docker Hub) and solve a few other reuse and sharing problems too.

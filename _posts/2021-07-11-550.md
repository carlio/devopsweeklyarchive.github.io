A comprehensive post on essential tools for Kubernetes, covering deployment, build, security, policy, higher-level interfaces, extensions and lots more. It does point to the size and complexity of the ecosystem now.

Tools
=====

Space Cloud is a Kubernetes based serverless platform that provides instant, real time APIs on any database, with event triggers. Think Firebase on Kubernetes.

Turbolift automates forking, cloning, committing, and raising PRs against a large number of Git repositories. Handy for those organization wide changes that sometimes need making like adding, removing or modifying specific files.

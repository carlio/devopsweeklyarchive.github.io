Great recommendations for running retrospectives of incidents, including a call to focus on what and how rather than who and why and to better understand various bias’ that are in play.

News
====

Fullerite is a new tool for metrics collection, similar to diamond or to collectd. This post serves as a nice introduction and explanation of why to build a new tool.

Nice write-up of a new infrastructure testing tool called Goss. Goss focuses on a purely declarative, data driven testing tool with JSON as the input format.

A nice article introducing a new build tool implemented using a F-Sharp based DSL. The post also explains why moving build logic into a tool like this is preferable to having it locked away in your CI system of choice.

A good explanation of why a service discovery mechanism is an important part of a microservices based architecture, and an introduction to a new high level .NET framework for service discovery called Microphone.

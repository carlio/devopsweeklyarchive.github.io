News
====

A nice set of talks on devops culture from the recent Puppetize event. Several good discussions of the overlap between technical practices and developer adoption.

If you’ve started experimenting with GitHub Actions then you’ll likely find something of interest in this 24 post series. Using the GitHub Script action caught my eye in particular.

I’m a fan of asking the question “what does infrastructure mean to you?” because it always raises different viewpoints. This post is a good example, looking at infrastructure as code from a wider definition of infrastructure.

A nice collection of common AWS Serverless architecture patterns, covering gateways, quesing, proxies and more.

An interesting post proposing a model for thinking about operational incidents.

Mainly a personal story of encountering and then adopting devops practices for security, but it’s interesting to think back how you first came across some of the terms and approaches in your career too.

Tools
=====

kf is a CLI tool for Knative which provides a cloud foundry-like deployment workflow. Just push your application code and the platform will build and run it.

Chubaofs is a distributed file system and object storage service for cloud native applications. It supports multi-tenancy, a POSIX-compatible and mountable filesystem as well as the S3 object storage interface.

Static analysis of infrastructure as code is looking like a hot topic for 2020. Checkov is a new tool which scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform and detects security and compliance misconfigurations.

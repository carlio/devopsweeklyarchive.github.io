Designing and building secure software is not easy, and few teams adopt a formal approach to solving the problem. The UK National Cyber Security Centre have published a handy set of 8 principles with which to test your development methodology.

The STELLA report from the SNAFU catchers consortium was published this week and makes interesting reading for anyone working on incident response or running large-scale systems. It contains writeups of several failures involving common technologies, delves into the theory and provides useful recommendations.

An excellent take on why monitoring is changing in the face of the adoption of cloud native platforms and microservice architectures. Nicely ties the co-evolution of the spaces together.

A good take on why Kubernetes is interesting. The point about having a single database of the state of all of your applications is super powerful in my view.

An excellent set of resources for anyone wanting to understand distributed systems. A nice, and not overlong, list of important books, papers and blog posts.

Detailed notes for a class on distributed systems. This is perfect if you already know some bits but maybe not the formal language and want to identify areas for more investigation.

A good post on the tension between the desire to fix the problem when an outage occurs and the need to communicate with users and others about the problem.

A good slide deck exploring practical things you and your team can do to improve the operability of your systems.

Microservices typically present some interesting challenges for testing, which can easily result in expensive, slow and brittle tests to quickly dominate. This post has some good tips for unit testing services.

An interesting look at the numbers behind the growth of hyper-scale public cloud provider datacenters, and why the idea that everything will rapidly move to the public cloud might play out more slowly.

Assessing risk, and using that assessment to help design systems or processes, is a useful skill. It’s critical to avoid under (or over) investment in securing systems in particular. This freely available workshop content serves as a great introduction to risk assessment fundamentals.

A nice detailed look at how docker handles failure of containers, looking at signals, exit codes, restart policies and health checks.

I think metadata for containers has the potential to unlock lots of useful shared tooling. So I’m super happy to see MicroBadger launch. It provides a simple way of visualising DOcker labels from images on Hub, as well as providing badges for use elsewhere.

A solid post on the state of systems operations today. Covering a focus on scalability, operations as a core skillset, a move away from dedicated operations teams in some smaller endeavours and other observations.

A biased, but interesting view on the value of distribution package maintainer, in particular with a view to universal packages or containers as a distribution mechanism for upstream vendors.

I’m all for people rediscovering make, it’s still a great tool to learn in my view. This blog post contains a set of notes aimed at hipsters, in this case people more familiar with the javascript build tool chain.

A nice walkthrough of using Kubernetes on Google Container Engine. Includes examples of some utility helpers if you’re powering everything via the kubectl command line interface.

A nice look at the problem with debugging tools that require you to update the source code (in particular pry for Ruby or pdb for Python) and an investigation into approaches using gdb.

A quick writeup of why the dev-sec project, which is providing configuration management code as well as test suites for hardening infrastructure, is interesting and important.

A nice detailed look at what serverless applications look like, and the first time I’ve seen the term function as a service used instead of the more controversial serverless moniker.

Two different survey results around container adoption were published this week, both with interesting data. As always, the samples tend to be weighted towards certain vendor combinations or early adopters. But useful nonetheless.

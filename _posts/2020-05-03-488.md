A detailed summary of modern deployment tools, looking at Jenkins-X, Flux and ArgoCD. A nice mix of facts and opinions.

Bash (or shell scripts in general) are still incredibly useful. This post points out a few common problems, and pointers for writing better bash scripts.

While it can be easy to think everyone already has automated deploying applications, it’s definitely not the case. This post contains a good list of benefits for those still making the business case.

A useful look at extracting binaries from container images without needing to pull the full image. Another example of the flexibility of the OCI spec.

A look at adding policy controls (using Open Policy Agent and Conftest) to Terraform deployments using Atlantis.

Something that has a lot of bearing on operations is complexity, and I think this post points to one issue with seemingly simple services being complex to operate in aggregate.

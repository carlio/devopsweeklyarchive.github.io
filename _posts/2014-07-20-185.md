Some big personal news from me this week. After 3 years working for the UK government I’m leaving to work for Puppet Labs out of London from September. With regards Devops Weekly, nothing will change, the newsletter remains a fun hobby rather than part of my new job. A shoutout to all the nice Puppet Labs folks reading this newsletter, I’ll see lots of you in Portland in September.

News

Last week saw the first Devopsdays Minneapolis and from the rest of this newsletter you’ll see it looked like a great event. This blog post from one of the organisers talks nicely about how to arrange one yourself.

A great presentation entitled “how to debug anything”. Lots of examples stepping through issues mainly using strace.

We see lots of discussion of devops from the point of view of engineers, and often from the point of view of the organisation, but this next post covers what it means for the role of product owner. I’ve played this role a few times and lots of this post matches my own experience.

One of the presentation from Devopsdays Minneapolis, placing devops on the hype cycle. Lots of examples placed on the peak of inflated expectations through the trough of disillusionment and out the other side.

Another of the presentation from Devopsdays Minneapolis on devops as a theory and on what Conway’s law means for devops.

A tongue-in-cheek presentation about “how to hire your first devop”. A few good points and a few jokes in there, probably not one to share if you’re just working out what this movement is about.

A nice set of principles for of metric driven development, talking about Instrumentation-as-Code, Single Source of Truth, Developers Curate Visualizations and Alerts, Alert onwhat you see, show me the Graph and Don’t Measure Everything.

The increasing hype around microservices is interesting, and I think one thing that leads to a focus on operations as some of the complexity is moved around. So this post is interesting, comparing the evolution of object orientated programming and interfaces to some of the challenges of microservices.

A nice insight into how Etsy does security. I think the main takeaway here is that it’s not (only) about web application attacks, side channels, lateral movement and your laptop are increasingly the a big attack vector.

Anode is a utility for analyzing graphite metrics. It’s currently quite experimental, containing a single three sigma analyzer that takes a time series from graphite and creates new metrics alongside.

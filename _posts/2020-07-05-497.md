env0 sponsors Devops Weekly
========================

Are you running Terraform locally? Want an easy way to automate it in a collaborative way? env0 is the easiest way to get started automating Terraform, giving you consistent templates, total visibility of what’s running, and automatic project level cost visibility.

News
====

Dashboards aren’t just used in computer operations, and we can always learn from other disciplines. This excellent essay on the history of urban dashboards is well worth reading.

A project to describe a set of reference architectures for AWS Serverless applications. Lots of hard won knowledge here. Starting with a simple web service, scalable webhook and strangler pattern.

An interesting paper on Residuality Theory, and the design of complex software systems. In particular looking at non-functional properties as first class citizens of design efforts.

Tools
=====

Vector is a lightweight, ultra-fast tool for building observability pipelines. Take data from files, syslog, statsd and more, then transform and output to S3, elasticsearch, prometheus, etc.

BeeMesh is intended to run services on a cluster of machines, using a peer-to-peer model and podman under the hood. Potentially interesting in edge scenarios.

News
====

I always like finding well written postmortems of incidents and this write up of some observations from reading several postmortems is excellent. Several common themes emerge.

I don’t generally cover point releases of tools due to the sheer volume but rkt 0.8 is worth a mention due to the new runtime which takes advantage of hardware virtualisation to better isolate containers from the host and each other.
<br>[https://coreos.com/blog/rkt-0.8-with-new-vm-support/](https://coreos.com/blog/rkt-0.8-with-new-vm-support/)


A great looking work-in-progress book on Agile IT Management. The author is looking for I reviewers and content contributors too.

Alpine Linux appears to be gathering steam as an ideal small linux to run inside containers. Here’s a good walkthrough of using it to build small Java based containers.

A good interview introducing Project Calico,  a virtualised layer 3 networking solution with some interesting integration with OpenStack and with container based systems like Kubernetes and Docker.

Some nice points about the advantages of using a single monolithic source code repository (as used by Google, Facebook, Twitter and others) rather than the one repository per project model which is probably more common.

A nice presentation on the increasing interest in single purpose computing for server applications, nicely tying this to containers and potentially on to unikernel based systems.

Another in this series on how to monitor, this time an in depth look at monitoring on Azure looking in particular at CPU, memory and network traffic.

An interesting discussion of a tool to deploy docker containers when the parent image changes.

An interesting look at the needs of a team adopting devops practices, modelled after maslow's hierarchy of needs.

A solid set of iptables examples. A good place to familiarise or brush up on host firewall rules.

Tools
=====

Testing infrastructure is one of my pet topics, so these cucumber steps for openshift looked interesting. Some good examples of how to use them to test your applications are able to be installed and run.

Mantl is a distribution of software for running a container based infrastructure. It aims to integrate Mesos, Docker, Kubernetes, Calico and Logstash amongst other tools.

Another interesting high-level distribution, Trusted Analytics integrates Cloud Foundry with various parts of the Hadoop ecosystem and aims to create a platform-as-a-service for data analytics.

Sellsword is an interesting looking tool to switch between different environments (say a set of environment variables) - handy if you support different clients or work on lots of separate projects.

News
====

A good history of the evolution of a large infrastructure, looking in particular at efficiency gains in terms of hardware, the datacenter itself and scheduling and service discovery at the application end.

A good discussion of some basic principles for anyone building a deployment pipeline, with a focus on immutable artefacts.

The number of frameworks in most programming languages purporting to support microservice-style architectures is growing. This post tries to distil what makes a good framework for building microservices.

>From 0 to DevOps in 80 days [Webinar]

“Innovate or die” may sound extreme, but it’s the only way to thrive in today’s ever competitive market. Bernd Greifeneder, CTO of Dynatrace, wanted to ensure that his company was relevant 5 years from now so he formed an internal incubator with one goal: transform Dynatrace into a Cloud Native DevOps organization. The results: Dynatrace now has a 99.998% availability of SaaS Service and can deploy changes within an hour if necessary. Join us for a discussion with Bernd as he shares lesson learned.

News

A set of good arguments for using a single monorepo for your organisation's code, including discussion of versioning and reviewing benefits.

A nice look at the future of serverless and function as a service architectures. Useful run down of areas that can and will hopefully be improved over the next year.

With the new BPF features in the very latest Linux Kernel, Linux now has tracing capabilities similar to those of the much loved dtrace programme. This post explains what’s possible and a little history of how it came about.

A suitably halloween themed talk on the potential for containers to introduce the types of culture and collaboration issues that devops set out to solve.

One of the amazing things about all the Devopsdays events cropping up is all the talk videos available of the talks. These talks from Devopsdays New Zealand are a great example.

AWS Advent is back, which means a fantastic blog post every day through most of December on all things AWS. But only if people sign up to write posts and to help with editing and proofreading.

A quick ITIL and Devops post, in particular making it clear they solve different, but related, issues and digging into the overlap around change control.

Getting started with containers does not mean jumping straight to a high-level clustered scheduling orchestrator. This post starts simple and in this cases looks at using rkt predominantly as a package/service analog.

Tools
=====

I’ve talked before about the potential for alternative container build tools. One such recent addition is box, which builds images using a subset of Ruby, using mruby embedded in a Go application.
<br>[https://github.com/erikh/box](https://github.com/erikh/box)


And for those more familiar with Puppet the recent Puppet image_build module allows for building containers images direct from Puppet’s domain specific language.

Lots of good content this week but a couple of posts on documenting microservice based systems in particular stood out for me. I’d love to see more examples of how people document systems for operators.

A nice look under-the-hood of how one organisation implemented a tracing system for a microservices architecture. The discussion of the data schema is particularly interesting.

An excellent post on how you can go about documenting a microservices architecture. Discussion of concepts as well as various documentation tools and approaches.

Another approach to documenting service based systems. This one using wireshark to capture traffic, and then generating traffic flow diagrams based on that capture. The post contains a video demo, sample code and some example images.

An interesting look at how one organisation is using Prometheus for monitoring, metrics and alerting for a huge globally distributed network.

Having curated this newsletter for 6 years or so, I’m interested in how we collectively talk about the craft of operations. Observability is definitely a word seeing more usage recently, this post tries to explain what and why.

Security has become a topic of increasing interest in the devops community over the past several years. The state of open source security survey should therefore be worth filling in and waiting on the results.

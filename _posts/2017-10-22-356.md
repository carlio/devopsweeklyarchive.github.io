As serverless becomes about more than just individual functions or services it requires a great deal of automation. This post talks about the result of that being the emergence of the serverless engineer.

My talk from Velocity in London this last week on the pros and cons of organising your source code in a monorepo, along with pointers to tools for working with one.

An excellent post on the importance of a staging environment. A good argument for why you need one, as well as tips and common gotchas.

A detailed set of blog posts looking at how to evolve a monolithic application into a set of microservices. A good grounding in why and theory, and a great practical example in Java.

Some good tips for ensuring secure practices in an infrastructure team. Written for company founders which also makes it useful for a general audience or those getting started.

A great set of notes on the pros and cons of different code organisation strategies - covering monorepos, manyrepos and metarepos as a transition approach.

A solid argument about the failure of architecture, or rather the desire to adopt approaches (like CQRS, event sourcing, single page apps) for projects which are unlikely to need them.

The following post is the simplest example I’ve seen of extending Kubernetes using custom resource definitions. Useful for anyone starting to investigate adding your own primitives to Kubernetes.

Free Webinar: How BI & Data Science Gets Results
November 16, Online

Statistical/data science models can now run on Hadoop in a much more cost-effective manner than a few years ago. This results in fostering the convergence of traditional BI and Data Science disciplines (machine learning, artificial intelligence... etc). Join the discussion with an incredible panel including ODPi, 4C Decision, ZEPL, and Pivotal, as we'll share how this phenomenon is going to impact the Hadoop standard.

OpenMetrics is a public working group looking to determine a standard for exposing metrics data, influenced by the Prometheus exposition format. I’m a big fan of adhoc agreement so hopeful this takes off.

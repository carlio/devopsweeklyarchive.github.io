A great reminder that behind any large improvement (like a devops transformation) probably lies an awful lot of hard work and iteration.

I’ll hopefully find a bunch more content from the recent Devops Enterprise conference over the next few weeks, but these brief notes give you an idea of some of the hot topics; agile adoption, auditing, tools and user acceptance testing.

A great starting point for anyone interested in the state of automation on Windows, especially if you’re coming from a lInux environment. Lots of snippets to get started with powershell, Chocolatey packages and winrm.

A survey all about the how mature our real world monitoring practices are. James Turnbull (of recent books on Logstash and Docker fame) is collecting the data for a talk next year.

With the 5th anniversary Devopsdays event about to happen it’s the perfect time to have a retrospective about where we are as a community. If you’re on twitter start suggesting ideas on #devopsstart, #devopsstop and #devopscontinue.

A nice post introducing a number of the practices required for continuous delivery. Mention of branching, feature toggles, monitoring, testing all in the context of speeding up deployment.

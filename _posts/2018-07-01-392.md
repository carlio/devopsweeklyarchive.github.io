News
====

Devops and Cloud Native are parallel movements that have a lot of crossover. This presentation explores that relationship, and is a nice introduction to both topics.

Prometheus is an increasingly popular monitoring tool aimed at cloud native environments. The new book Monitoring with Prometheus covers everything from the core concepts to installation and how to monitor an application. Subscribers can get a 25% discount using the code DEVOPSWEEKLY.

An interesting post on the move from a monolith to microservices, focused on losing visibility into the system and the additional of tracing. Some interesting notes about database observability too.

Helm has become an important tool for lots of Kubernetes users, and Helm 3 comes with a number of new features (including Lua-based object definition.) This post introduces the changes.

A roundup of the a recent devops and security survey, some interesting data about how developers and operators think about the security challenge and what tooling and practices are in use.

A case study of using Kubernetes at the edge, looking at the architecture, installation and deployment.

This isn’t just a Kubernetes issue but in my experience a more general open source issue. Support for Windows often comes later, but is required for projects that want to see the widest possible adoption.

The command line is an important tool for most systems administrators, and it’s an area Windows has typically lagged behind in. This post, looking at the evolution of the Windows command line, shows things changing for the better.

Successfully embracing devops in a security team needs involvement from across the organisation. This post looks at the main roles involved and their part in the process.

Access and Identify is a deep topic, no more so when it comes to AWS. This post does a good job of explaining the current situation and related problems, and discusses potential improvements.

Gatekeeper (the Kubernetes policy enforcement tool) now has an alpha capability to mutate resources. This post is a good introduction, including an example of automatically fixing pod security admission issues.

A good post on service level objectives. It starts out with a good introduction, but it’s nice to see concrete examples and discussion of how to implement this in code, in this case with Ruby and Java.

Some good posts on operations fundamentals this week, including security policy and the relationship between delivery speed and stability, as well as a case study of a migration. Also some new tools in the monitoring, deployment and service mesh spaces.

News
====

The CNAB specification, which is a standard packaging format for multi-component distributed applications, just hit 1.0. These two posts explain some of the background and why it’s important.

An interesting article exploring the idea of policy debt. In particular looking at security policies and a generational divide between architectures that favour encryption and those that obsess over firewalls. The post also observes that policy encodes culture which is an interesting lens through which to view the problem.

The relationship between delivery speed and stability is much more interesting that simply being in opposition. High performing operations teams achieve both. This post explores how, and why that’s important.

An interesting story about migrating from one provider to another, based on available features. Data wasn’t really an issue here, but some good points about the potential in open APIs for portability.

The Cluster API project aims to bring declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. It’s making good progress it seems and the documentation is a useful read.

A call for better build tools focused on the problems we see with microservice environments vs the larger monolithic binaries many build tools are best suited for. Lots of interesting things happening in this space.

A good writeup of using Open Policy Agent to enforce policy in a CI environment, in this case policy around dependencies in a Node.js project.

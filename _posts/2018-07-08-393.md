A post on the human scalability of devops. Lots of good points, although the arguments are based on a specific definition and a startup usecase. In my experience large organisations are better about the non-fungibility of engineers.

Metrics and measurement are important parts of adopting devops but using the wrong metrics, or not evolving those metrics as your organisation evolves, can be problematic.

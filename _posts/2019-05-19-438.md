We generally agree that collecting metrics is a good thing, but how do you decide what to measure? This presentation explores part of that question, looking at what vanity metrics are and why you should avoid them.

A counterpoint to the argument that serverless represents a new type of lockin. Some good points, but I’d love to see posts with more historical context about lockin in IT.

A good discussion of the challenges of cluster lifecyle management for Kubernetes, and an introduction to the new Cluster API which has just hit v1alpha1 and provides a declarative API for managing Kubernetes clusters.

A quick reminder that web logs have lots of useful information in them, and that many of them can be configured to provide more with simple configuration. The post provides a few nginx tips, but I think this is true of most good web servers.

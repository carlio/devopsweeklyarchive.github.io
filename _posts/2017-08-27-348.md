Interesting post this week about why devops practices appear to be catching on in the real world, along with academic research into post-incident reviews and a few solid technical posts too.

AI-Powered DevOps: Injecting Speed & Quality Across Verizon’s Cloud Pipelines

With customer experience being a top priority, Verizon turned to an automated delivery pipeline approach that leveraged cloud and container technology. This enabled teams to deploy new features faster, directly into production. But it also increased technical complexity. Learn how Verizon used Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered monitoring, and was able to transcend this problem, and today easily manages complex, web-scale DevOps in the cloud.

Interesting observation about why devops might be working in places where previous service management processes failed; it’s all about the focus on people.

Excellent talk on the potential for firmware to make systems hard to debug, especially those systems dealing with storing data.

Post-incident reviews, or post-mortems, are an important practice for teams running systems in production. Taking this survey, part of an academic research project, should help us as a community understand them better.

Naming is important, as it allows us to discuss and share ideas about specific concepts. This post looks to define observability, and how it differs from monitoring. A useful distinction.

Building serverless systems on Lambda often involves integrating with other supporting services. This post contains a good introduction to SQS usage with Lambra for building async systems.

Squash looks like an interesting idea to build a debugger for microservices. Currently it supports Kubernetes and VSCode. The rolling demo gives you an idea of how it works.

News
====

Adopting new technologies or practices may give you an advantage, or take you down the wrong path. How do you decide? This post has lots of good concrete suggestions as well as context for the ever-moving landscape.

A walkthrough of a presentation on chaos engineering traps, common issues that people adopting chaos engineering practices for the first time often run into. Lots of context and good advice.

CASE is a method for improving monitoring, in particular on-call handling. It provides teams and organizations a way to discuss the care and feeding of automated alerting with a degree of formal language and emphasis on what’s important.

A look at an interesting serverless pattern, removing the need for functions to transform incoming data and moving that responsibility into the API gateway. More examples of why FaaS is only part of the serverless approach.

As the systems we build get more complex we change how we manage them. Monitoring (observability) and testing (chaos engineering) have seen lots of discussion but what about the rest of ITSM?

The next post provides a useful primer for designing scalable database systems, looking at horizontal and vertical scaling, read replicas, sharding and application to microservices architectures.

Another good database post, this one covering implementing a load testing tool for a postgresql cluster. Good technical details for anyone interested in postgres and a good debugging story too.

I’ve always considered the relationship between testing and operations to be close. This post introduces logging, monitoring and alerting from the point of view of a tester, useful to convince folks who haven’t made the leap yet.

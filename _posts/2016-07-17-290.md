An interesting opinion about improving the state of software security, by taking influences from the evolution of testing and software quality over the past 10+ years.

It’s common to have some sort of intermediary QA environment for various forms of testing. It’s also too common for that environment to be poorly maintained and often to make it slow to get changes into production safely. Some tips to fix the impasse.

A nice practical container adoption story, focused on the benefits of a single deployment artefact and eschewing introducing a scheduler.

Another practical container story, this time in a much larger enterprise organisation which chose to use Puppet along with Docker UCP to build and manage a container platform.

A good list of the good, bad and ugly when it comes to adopting a platform (or indeed container) as a service. Everything from issues with networking and metrics to the advantages of consistency.

SQL is pretty amazing, but can be hard to get your head around more than just the basics. This post provides a great beginners guide to the important concepts.

A great review of the recent Realtime Data Processing at Facebook paper. The paper covers the variety of different tools used and build for realtime data analytics and introduces 5 design decisions for anyone building similar systems.

Tools
=====

Sanctuary is a handy tool for launching a Vault instance in AWS. It provides a simple tool which configures AWS services like S3 (for logs), DynamoDB (for secrets) and a VPC network, along with certs from letsencrypt.

LeverOS is an open source serverless (or function-as-a-service) platform. Functions are written in Javascript and uploaded by the included tools, and can then be executed using the same tool or via an HTTP API.

If you’re seriously using AWS you often end up with multiple credentials to manage, whether for multiple accounts of IAM profiles. Enter ASAM, which provides a handy utility to switch between accounts, as well as helpers for ssh and scp.

[https://github.com/mheffner/awsam](https://github.com/mheffner/awsam)


A nifty way of assigning IAM credentials to individual docker containers rather than to hosts. Involves some iptables hackery but useful for some usecases.

Kong is an interesting looking proxy built atop Nginx, but exposing configuration via a simple HTTP API and allowing for a set of pre-existing plugins to be added to individual routes.

AI-Powered DevOps: Injecting Speed & Quality Across Verizon’s Cloud Pipelines

With customer experience being a top priority, Verizon turned to an automated delivery pipeline approach that leveraged cloud and container technology. This enabled teams to deploy new features faster, directly into production. But it also increased technical complexity. Learn how Verizon used Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered monitoring, and was able to transcend this problem, and today easily manages complex, web-scale DevOps in the cloud.

An excellent article on the differences of opinion, and their underlying causes, around how software should be packaged.

Immutable infrastructure is, in my view, a great idea with a bunch of little-discussed practical considerations. I had a chat with Rob from RackN this week on the topic which is hopefully of interest to folks.

A decent article covering using Terraform to manage a AWS Lambda function. Covers monitoring, environments, bundling dependencies and more.

A good discussion of the practicality and costs of exactly-once message queues, summarising various other discussions and providing a good summary and observations.

Lots of discussion at the moment about more intelligent use of monitoring, in particular combining different sources of data to provide context to events. This post has a good example why this is so powerful.

Different ways of organising code have different tradeoffs, and warrant differentiating tooling, especially at different scales. This post is an interesting look at how the Linux kernel source code is maintained, and the people, processes and tools which contribute.

A good presentation on secrets management, featuring a look at features of a good secrets solution, some of the pros and cons of using Vault, and then looking at the AWS Parameter Store.

An interesting post about the utility of unikernels for more than just replacing existing workloads or architectures.

The concept of psychological safety is a useful part of talking about team culture. This post has some great specific examples of behaviours to watch out for.

Interesting post on some of the side-effects of adopting a service mindset, namely that your colleagues become customers, and on how you can adopt customer-centric measures to make sure the system is operating as expected.

A post on multi-cloud and its relationship to lockin, placing the fears of lockin alongside the relatively low onboarding costs and rapid innovation.

This post makes the important point that any successful attempt to adopt devops practices in a large organisation has to address the mismatch between traditional IT project-centric governance and the the needs of flow.

Notes from a conversation at configuration management camp back in February, about the mismatch between modern infrastructure environments and classic ITSM tenets. In particular looking at CMDB as something that should be useful to everyone, but maybe isn’t.

A look at using CRDTs for service discovery. Contains a good overview of other options, including DNS and tools like etcd and zookeeper, and why they chose CRDTs with Akka as an alternative.

Free Webinar: How BI & Data Science Gets Results
November 16, Online

Statistical/data science models can now run on Hadoop in a much more cost-effective manner than a few years ago. This results in fostering the convergence of traditional BI and Data Science disciplines (machine learning, artificial intelligence... etc). Join the discussion with an incredible panel including ODPi, 4C Decision, ZEPL, and Pivotal, as we'll share how this phenomenon is going to impact the Hadoop standard.

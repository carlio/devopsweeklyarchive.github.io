A good post looking at a study into alarm fatigue in a hospital and what can be learned and applied to alert fatigue in monitoring. A call to actions too for companies to publish studies analysing different alert management techniques.

Some good points about the real benefit of microservices being in how organisations and teams work. Also a good reminder that if you’re building for the web you’re already being distributed systems whether you like it or not.

An interesting perspective on the different ways to reach a devops culture. I’m not sure I agree completely, for instance event attendees vary wildly from event to event or between geographies, but some good observations.

A new infrastructure focused podcast, Software Defined Talk. Quite an industry focus, with observations about identity and access management and VMware’s cloud moves.

Tools

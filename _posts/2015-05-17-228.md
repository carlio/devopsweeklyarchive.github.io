News

The interest in Devops is still spreading but how can the wider community help even more people successfully adopt these practices? Some great suggestions here, especially the call for community reference implementations.

This post discusses the impact of devops on outsourcing maintenance as a separate activity from developing through a system’s entire life cycle.

An interesting post that makes the claim that SIAM (Service Integration and Management for those not involved in the Service Management community) and DevOps are two sides of the same coin.

A couple of interesting tools for analyzing mysql and postgresql database network traffic. Think tcpdump or wireshark but with an understanding of databases.

A call that the CAP theorem as generally described is too simplistic for real world tradeoff discussions, especially when describing databases as CP or AP.

A post I wrote on using Test Kitchen, ServerSpec and Bats to test software installation as well as usage, in this case for compiling and running MirageOS unikernels.

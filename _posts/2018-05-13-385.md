The State of Devops survey is back for another year and I hope everyone can make some time to take it. The data, and resulting analysis, is of huge value to the wider devops community when it comes to knowing what’s working and how to help others understand why.

The State of Devops survey is open for this year, closing on June 8th. The data and analysis from the State of Devops report is hugely valuable, and the more folks take the survey the better. It should only take you 20 minutes.

A practical post on various SRE practices which also has the clearest description of the relationship between SRE and Devops I’ve seen, describing SRE as an implementation of Devops.

A good post on why it’s often not a zero-sum game when it comes to technology adoption, in this case looking at Kubernetes and Serverless.

Debugging complex microservices architectures running on an orchestrator is very different to debugging a classic monolith. This post explores the state of debugging on Kubernetes and shows some of the ongoing work in this space.

An interesting post on complexity in software, looking specifically at the question of whether Kubernetes is too complicated for many users and usecases.

There are quite a few tools which are databases but are often not thought about as such. That can lead to forgetting about things like backups. This post shows how to backup consult data, including encrypting backups and some other useful tricks.

Tools
=====

Consistently bootstrapping development environments is something that definitely benefits from a shared set of scripts. This new project builds on Chocolatey and Boxstarter to provide a great starting place for Windows environments.

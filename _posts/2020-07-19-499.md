========================

Do you have an automated maintenance mode set up for your application and API? No matter how highly available your infrastructure might be, everyone should. Check out Omry's blog post on how to easily build one using terraform (including all the code!)

A good post on migrating to the cloud via a lift and shift strategy. When is this the best choice, and what do you need to do to make it work in the long term.

A presentation on the impact of uncertainty on operating systems. Elasticity, scalability, devops practices, playbooks; lots of good operations topics covered.

The question of whether you should directly call one Lambda function from another comes up regularly in Serverless architecture conversations. This post has some tips why this isn’t always a good idea and when to avoid.

If you’ve ever just wanted to make regularly running a shell script easier to do on Kubernetes then the shell operator is worth taking a look at.

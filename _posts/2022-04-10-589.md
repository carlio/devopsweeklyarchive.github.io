Three posts on building reliable (people and technical) systems at scale, incident response processes and platform engineering this week that all feel like modern takes on classic systems operation.

As you can probably guess from this newsletter, I like learning new things. This next post looks at things communities can do to make learning by lurking easier. A big plus-one on public discourse.

WIth the ubiquity of Kubernetes clusters lots of compute jobs have moved to running in Kubernetes clusters, including the venerable cronjob. This post explains how to configure cronjob resources and looks at monitoring and logging too.

Tools
=====

Kaar, like tar but for Kubernetes. Package up all the manifests and container images into a single OCI archive.

Bubblewrap provides a container runtime tool aimed at providing unprivileged sandboxes, unlike most existing approaches, this is intended for running untrusted code.

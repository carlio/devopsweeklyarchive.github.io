So it was great to hear stories from Disney, Barclays, Zurich Insurance and others talking about the same topics and practices. I’ll try and track down some of the content for future issues.

Industry surveys are interesting, but often of small and technology specific groups. So this one piqued my interest. The data on container adoption is a good sample to sit alongside more container-centric surveys, and the CI numbers are interesting too.

On-call doesn’t have to be a horror movie. Incident response data and tools can be used to improve on-call rotations, escalation policies, and collaboration. Read about some on-call horror stories and see how you can better avoid on-call disasters:

The second post in a series on patterns for helping organisation adopt devops and agile practices and principles. This post focuses on the benefits of making things smaller in scope to achieve the biggest impact over time.

Encouraging organisations to change practices and adopt devops principles can rarely be done by edict. This post delves a bit into how to build alliances between different business units or groups.

A tale of going from no appreciable monitoring to instrumenting a application and it’s infrastructure, and identifying some large performance gains in the process.

An argument that ITSM and devops are more closely aligned than people sometimes thing, with the interesting observation about the common mistake of underestimating the importance of culture.

A quick comparison, along with examples, of using different tools to configure an AWS serverless environment, looking at Terraform, Serverless framework and the new AWS CDK.

An interesting behind-the-scenes look at the architecture and technology stack for an ecommerce operation. Discussion of technology choice over time and the tools used to build and deploy the applications.

A set of useful serverless use cases (like email, video processing, cron, etc.), albeit with examples tied heavily to AWS functionality.

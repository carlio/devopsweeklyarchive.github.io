A solid argument for why you shouldn’t use environment variables for secrets, in particular that the use of ENV for secrets provides lots of opportunities for secrets to be accidentally leaked.

Many readers of this newsletter probably spend a fair amount of time at the command line, so this criticism of how we view this user interface is likely worth reading (although it would have been interesting to get a view of PowerShell in there too.)

Many systems expose some sort of API for other systems to consume, but what makes an API fit-for-purpose? This post looks at the importance of monitoring, acceptance tests, generated documentation and other good ideas.

One of the issues for some with the unikernel approach is the need to use specific programming languages. This demonstration shows a possible alternative, in this case transpiling PHP.

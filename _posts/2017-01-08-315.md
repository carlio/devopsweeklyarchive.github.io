News

Being on-call and incident response are recurring topics for the newsletter so this new site is well worth a read. In-depth guides on preparing an on-call schedule, responding to events and what to do afterwards. It’s available under an Apache license as well so you can use it in your organisation.

The videos from all the LISA16 talks have been posted, and a whole bunch are likely relevant to readers. A whole range of talks on monitoring, load balancers, discussions of operations as a discipline and lots of talks about operations culture.

A good look under the hood of the Docker daemon, looking at dockerd, containerd, runc and how the processes work together.

How containers get rebuilt is an unsolved problem for many, and the nature of how most people are using containers (with an embedded operating system) can lead to some critical issues.

A thorough hello world walkthrough for using Concourse CI for continuous integration. Lots of code examples and screenshots.

A nice example of using various AWS services to ensure end-to-end encryption of application traffic. A nice non-trivial CLoudFormation example ties it together.

I’ve included several links to The Morning Paper over the last year or so, but this catch up of some of the highlights is worth reading for newcomers or folks not already subscribed.

Security is now firmly embedded as one of the strands of devops I think. This post goes into detail about adding security testing to a continuous delivery pipeline

Some good tips for anyone wanting to make sure there Docker images are up to date with security patches.

A nice detailed set of content for anyone deploying OpenShift in a secure environment, especially in the US Federal Government. It covers specific compliance regimes and a long list of controls.

Tools
=====

Cherami is a new distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available message queue system. The accompanying blog post does a good job of explaining why another queuing server, and the animations give you a good sense of the design.

Grumpy is a Python to Go source code transcompiler and runtime. That means you can convert your Python code to a Go static binary, avoiding the python global interpreter lock and runtime dependency. Still early days but very interesting.

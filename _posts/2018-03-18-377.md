AppSwitch is a new approach to providing an abstraction over the network stack, in particular it offers the possibility for containers not to require an IP address, or even a full IP stack to converse over the network.

An in-depth look at proxies as a tool for iteratively evolving and refactoring APIs. Useful illustrations of the problem and how to approach it using a proxy.

A well-told story of migrating from one network provider to another while minimising any interruption. Infrastructure as code, DNS, unit testing APIs and other interesting topics.

A good discussion of SRE in the context of Devops and Cloud Native. The post makes the case for an architectural pattern, a job function and a process working together.

An argument for Zip files as the unit of deployment, in the context of Serverless. I think the more general point is aiming for the highest abstraction that makes sense.

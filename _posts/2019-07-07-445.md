For some reason this issue is nearly all about monitoring. Lots of slides, videos and notes from the recent Monitorama event but also several blog posts looking in depth at logs, traces, metrics and alerting.

News

The Monitorama conference took place in Portland, Oregon a few weeks back, and folks have been writing up posts summarising some of the talks and conversations. All of the slides and videos are available too.

Who hasn’t had a drawn out conversation about how long to retain logs? This post explores the basics, from regulation to usefulness of keeping logs around.

Distributed tracing has been around a while, but this post explores why it’s not as useful or widely used as you might assume. This post explores one area for improvement, the primary user interface for trace data.

A nice writeup of evolving a monitoring stack. The post doesn’t just look into the technical components, but into the business reasons for the change, and how the tools where used to avoid needless alerts out of hours.

Another monitoring post, this one exploring logs vs metrics, or more accurately pointing out that it’s a false dichotomy and you’ll want both anyway.

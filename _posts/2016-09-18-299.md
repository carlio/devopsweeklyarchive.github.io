News
====

An impassioned plea that microservices probably won’t fix your problems, and come with a multitude of downsides that you really should consider first.

Containers are still very new for the majority of folks, even for a newsletter like Devops Weekly. So questions from those learning are super useful for everyone. Here’s a great set thinking about adopting docker or rkt into a production environment.

A great review of the 2007 paper On designing and deploying internet-scale services from James Hamilton. You should read the paper too but the review does a good job of picking out important points for anyone architecting modern systems today.

A detailed and practical look at moving towards a service based architecture, and adopting Mesos and Marathon to deal with scaling out the services.

An interesting article about modern application layer security, looking at the impact of chatops, correlation of events, visualization and more.

Some interesting observations about the crossover of operations and security from the recent Devopsdays Chicago event. Gets to the fact the issues are often organisational and cultural as much as technical.

A good user report of using the Zipkin tracing application for monitoring requests through a microservices architecture. A few hints and tips for anyone else looking at tracing in general too.

Collected videos from the recent Facebook Scale event. Talks cover everything from monorepos to using GPUs for deep learning and open source in large organisations to improved file compression algorithms.

If you have applications creating local logs you probably want to ship them somewhere. This post covers strengths and weaknesses of several tools in the space including logstash, fluentd and syslog-ng.

An interesting post that rings true for learning any new tool or technology I think. In this case it’s the story of learning, and then using in a work context, machine learning approaches.

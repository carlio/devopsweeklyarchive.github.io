One of the interesting things for me over the last 5+ years of observing the devops community is their are always more related groups getting involved. The first link this week is a good example of this, a list of posts all about how devops practices and principles are changing the role of the traditional IT service desk.

Lots of large and medium sized organisations will operate a service desk, but I’ve not read a lot about the impact or influences of devops on them. This post has 7 interesting articles on just that topic.

An insightful post on the evolution (or needed evolution) of a security systems development lifecycle, touching on many devops practices.

Building secure software and systems is increasingly of interest, and this set of design principles is a great starting point. It’s split into three main categories: Making services hard to compromise, Reducing the impact of a compromise and Making compromises easy to detect.

tcpdump is pretty amazing. This post shows why, and nicely starts with a useful example of debugging slow HTTP requests.

Once you start looking at containers you’re forced to ask the question, how should I break up my application? What runs in what container? This post contains some recommendations and common reasons for making the call.

A survey looking at an area of containers that’s arguably less well understood and less mature than some others, storage. The results of the survey should be posted later, so look out for a link to that in a future issue.

I always like reading counter arguments to things, including to Devops. I think the following conflates some particular practices with the higher-level definition of devops as a cultural movement. But it’s interesting nonetheless.

Tools
=====

Most large organisations have a formal set of security controls, but how best to apply and monitor them? OSCAL is the Open Security Controls Assessment Language, a new project describing schemas and tools, including some examples of applying this new language via unit tests.

Building custom versions of Nginx can be useful, either because you want to utilise a specific library version (like OpenSSL) or because you have first or third-party custom modules. This handy build script does all the heavy lifting.

How we measure outcomes or activities can often have an impact on those same activities. Knowing what to set as a key performance indicator is sometimes easy, but that’s often not the case for security. This post explores approaches to the problem.

Tools
=====

Kubepox looks a handy tool for anyone wanting to explore how network policies affet traffic in a Kubernetes cluster.

Mimic is a tool for authoring configuration in Go. It uses a provider model to help generate specific config files and offer a typed interface so you can use it for, for instance, generating HCL for Terraform and YAML for Kubernetes at the same time.

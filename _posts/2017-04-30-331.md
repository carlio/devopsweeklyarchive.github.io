News

A good list of some of the advantages of standardising on a single unit of software (in this case Docker) and on a platform (ECS on AWS), looking at open source, security and billing.

A really interesting piece placing digital transformation and ITSM in context, I particularly liked the observation that “most enterprise IT functions were built around service provision, rather than product innovation.”

A good blog post and accompanying presentation all about how serverless computing changes security, for the better and for the worse.

A solid post which places many of the practices and tools we talk about under the devops banner in the context of the common manual approaches that came before. The post goes on to talk about what you need to do to get into devops coming from that background.

An update to a post from a few years ago, on Docker adoption. The sample size and consistency over several samples makes for interesting observations.

An excellent deep-dive blog post on docker overlay networks and how they work, based on a talk from the recent DockerCon conference.

Interesting analysis on what causes flaky tests. The results aren’t super surprising, but the methodology and dataset size are interesting.

A slidedeck on building resilient microservice systems, looking at the inevitable failures in distributed systems and the use of bulkheads to prevent cascading failures.

Free Webinar Series – The “How-To” of Cloud-native Traffic Management with Ranga Rajagopalan of Avi Networks

Containers bring a new level of agility and speed to app development, while also demanding a new architecture for the application services managing these microservices and apps, particularly in regards to traffic management. In this webinar, we will discuss how cloud-native traffic management must be approached differently and how dev, app, and network teams can work synchronously to deliver microservices applications.

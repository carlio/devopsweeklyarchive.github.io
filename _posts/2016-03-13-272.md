News

An excellent write up of a Devops flavoured event at the RSA security conference. Lots of links to the presentations at the conference, as well as takeaways including the potential of compliance as code and applying lean to security processes.

A good collection of options on whether ITIL and DevOps are compatible? A useful introduction to set that scene as well.

A good exploration of deployment in a cloud environment, in particular looking at the advantage of having a single way of making changes and exploring different concepts which underpin some of the common deployment implementations.

A nice reminder that, even if the default settings take security into consideration, common user behaviours can undermine those. The example given is of the dangers of mounting the Docker socket into containers.

Tools
=====

Juttle is described as a dataflow programming language. Along with the language are an entire ecosystem of tools for using it to interpret data from graphite, elasticsearch, slack, AWS, various databases and more. Interesting to see more examples of how this fits into a monitoring setup.

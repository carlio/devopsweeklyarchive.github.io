Threat modelling is a useful tool for getting people thinking about the security of their systems. It’s also a great way of encouraging collaboration between development and security teams. This new manifesto is a good starting point.

gRPC is optimised for fast, secure over-the-wire transfer. But that makes it harder to debug than something like JSON over HTTP. Here’s how to use Wireshark for analyzing gRPC messages.

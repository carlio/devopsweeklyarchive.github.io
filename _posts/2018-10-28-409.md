Tools
====

Dive is a handy tool for analysing Docker image layers. It provides a very nice CLI interface showing what changes between layers and giving an idea of space you could save with further optimisation.

Kimchi is a nice looking dashboard for managing KVM guests via libvirt. View templates, running guests and start new instances.

A collection of tools for working with container registries. Copy images from one place to another, check what tags are available in a registry, get the digest of an image and more.

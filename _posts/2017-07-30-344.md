A great post arguing that while the last decade was all about teaching sysadmins to write code, the next will be about teaching operations to software developers.

Another interesting post on the future of operations, with some similarities and some differences to the post above. Good points about the broad scope of things we often bundle under operations.

A simple explanation of what Google have been up to with BBR, a new backoff algorithm for TCP which appears to improve performance with just some changes to the serving application.

An interesting tale of debugging a production performance issue on a public cloud. Useful stuff for anyone needing to understand how quotas for I/O work, and BurstBalance on AWS in particular.

A good conversation about the importance of semantics when discussing architecture, in particular digging into what we mean when we talk about monoliths.

A post in praise of gRPC for service communications. Lots of code examples and pros and cons vs other options and attempts at the same sort of thing.

Some good tips for focusing development effort on issues which result in support queries, with a few real-world examples.

A quick comparison of when you might choose Google Cloud Functions vs Google Container Engine. Mainly relevant for the more general serverless vs container orchestrators question.

A description of the new StackSets functionality for CloudFormation, making it much easier to specify resources across multiple accounts and regions at the same time.

A couple of posts centered on the problem of sharing data across teams, without getting in each other’s way. The first post looks at some anti-patterns while the second explores alternatives.

Management tools tend to need a great deal of access to your systems to do there job, so protecting the interfaces to those management tools should be a priority. Some good advice and discussion of common patterns.

A nice look at the new LinuxKit project announced at DockerCon. This post delves into running the build tools and demonstrating how testing works, as a way to understand the potential of the tool.

An excellent writeup of issues with not securing a Kubernetes infrastructure during a recent CTF exercise. The issues are well explained, and nicely demonstrate the new attack surface areas with new tools.

Building systems automatically based on metadata is a lot less effort than describing them upfront. This post provides a great example of this looking at configuring monitoring and logging for applications running on Kubernetes.

A quick introduction to the challenges of Windows server automation, and a look at the Chocolatey package manager, including the DSC integration.

I included a wide ranging infrastructure survey a few months back, and the results of that survey have just been published. Data on the adoption of configuration management tools, deployment pipelines, container adoption and more.

A nice summary of why ITIL and Devops are not incompatible. I like the statement “ITSM is Devops best practice.”

It’s always interesting to read people's views of devops and this post makes some good observations about the changing role of developers and operators. I don’t buy all of it, and it’s too San Francisco centric, but a worthwhile read.

Another good view of devops, again not one I completely buy into. The argument here is the operability is a clearer thing to aim for that the less easily measured devops.

A good explanation of why you might want to turn over infrastructure on a regular basis, in this case terminating and restarting containers and hosts every day. No mention of dealing with forensics in this model of operations though.

Some good tips for anyone maintaining a Chef infrastructure (or really any large codebase) in particular focused on good naming practices and building for collaboration.

An interesting way of explaining AWS VPC networking via a town planning analogy. Useful given the large number of concepts in the VPC APIs.

A good first-hand report of dealing with an incident at scale, and the importance of holding a postmortem.

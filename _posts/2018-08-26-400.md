Good tips for ensuring the software release process is robust, emphasising that this means clear ownership and treating deployment software like the critical production system it is.

An interesting look at a forensics tool for cloud environments. Diffy picks up on differences between hosts that should be the same, and flags those for further investigation.

A how-to for using AWS System Manager Parameter Store to store secrets, and other configuration, for your applications running on AWS.

The 12 factor applications pattern has been hugely influential, however this post takes issue with the use of environment variables for configuration. I see that as an interface requirement, how you manage that configuration is a separate concern.

Kube Hunter is a handy tool for testing the security of a Kubernetes cluster. It can be run from outside the cluster or, interestingly, as a Pod to check what a compromised application would be able to access.

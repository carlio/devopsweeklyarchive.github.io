A typical wide range of content this week, with tales of transforming large organisations alongside cross-compiling Docker images for ARM. I do sometimes wonder if the readers of this newsletter enjoy the variety under the Devops banner as much as I do.

A Tale of Two Pipelines: To DevOps or Not to DevOps

Trying to move to a DevOps methodology, or improve your current DevOps methods? Need to increase innovation and the speed of your software delivery pipeline? Brett Hofer, Global DevOps Practice Lead at Dynatrace, will show you how through a tour of two pipelines.

News
====

Devops has become accepted as an important part of wider business transformation efforts over the past several years. Sometimes it’s a good idea to look for stories that make that context clearer, like this one about ING.

Google have published a comprehensive white paper about how they secure their infrastructure. This covers details of hardware security all the way to people matters, along with guiding principles and design. Essential reading.

Linux containers aren’t magic, as this post points out. A dive into containers without Docker or rkt, looking in detail at cgroups, chroot and file systems.

Chaos Monkey, or a similar tool, is generally assumed to be running on a schedule. But using a handy CLI tool it’s possible to trigger different failure conditions manually, and this post explains when that might be useful.

The requirements for persistent storage tend to change over time in many applications as they, and the team supporting them, grow. A nice example of that in the following post, and details of some of the challenges of moving data.

Having testing as a core developer responsibility is common in high-performing teams. But load and performance tests are often separate and remain the preserve of specialists. This post argues that that’s a mistake.

An interesting argument that the Linux and Windows worlds are converging, and that for many applications or technology choices it’s no-longer about just picking one.

As ARM platforms become more commonplace, building containers that target ARM architectures will come up more and more. It’s possible to do this using QEMU on more common intel machines with a few commands.

Systemdlogger is a small tool to used to export systemd journald logs to an external service, for example cloudwatch or elasticsearch. It’s designed to be simple, simpy running out of cron.

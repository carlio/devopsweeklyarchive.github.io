News

A good delve into scaling graphite, in this case looking at minimizing the lag for certain metrics being queryable with Kernel-level I/O tuning and other tricks.

A great intro to various aspects of systems thinking with regards complex web based systems, with tips for embracing complexity, designing for resilience and testing in production.

A good post on the issue of security and linux containers (and docker in particular). Clearly explains the current differences between containers and virtualisation based on kernel subsystems and namespaces.

A nice walkthrough of a particular infrastructure workflow based on Packer, Chef and CloudFormation. Lots of reasoned detail around moving from development to production.

If you’re using AWS you’ll probably have made decisions about which regions and zones to use for different workloads. This post delves into some simple benchmarks for upload speeds with some interesting findings.

A nice piece pondering on the relationship between infrastructure acceptance testing and monitoring. I still think there are lots of good patterns to discover here.

A very detailed step-by-step guide to setting up a continuous integration pipeline with Jenkins. Touches on the intended workflow for people using the pipeline as well.

Jobs
====

We thought the process of finding a new DevOps job needed to be shaken up. So we built Hired, the first true marketplace for engineers. Join a Hired one-week auction and let 1,000+ companies compete for you.

Evernote is hiring! Our goal is to be an ever-innovating, globally-inspired, benefit-obsessed company for the next 100 years. This requires a singular focus on making the absolute best and smartest product possible. That means, we need talented individuals, like yourself, to help us.

Events
======

DevopsDays Toronto is coming up on the 12th and 13th of September. The call for proposals has just closed so expect the programme shortly. Still room for sponsors too.

Tools
====

Managing local machines with Vagrantfiles has lots of advantages, but when recreating that environment in production you might turn to something like libcloud. Duplicate no more, with with vagrant driver for libcloud.
<br>[https://github.com/carletes/libcloud-vagrant](https://github.com/carletes/libcloud-vagrant)


Terraform is a tool aimed at giving you a single view of your entire infrastructure in code. Describe instances and supporting services (like DNS) via a domain specific language and use the command line tool to launch across multiple infrastructure providers.
<br>[http://www.terraform.io/](http://www.terraform.io/)


Consul is an orchestration mechanism with fault-tolerance based on the gossip protocol and a key/value store that is eventually consistent. Hiera-consul will allow hiera to write to the k/v store for metadata centralisation and harmonisation.

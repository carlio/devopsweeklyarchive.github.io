Integrity is probably the theme in hindsight this week. If you haven’t already do read the first post about weak default cryptography and what you can do about it. This nicely leads onto the results from the recent ethics in operations survey.

How Automation Can Help You Build a Bigger And Better Pipeline

Join our webinar to learn how a 5-point maturity model helped a Fortune 500 company transform themselves into a full-fledged DevOps company, and how it can do the same for your company.  You’ll also learn how automation can help you build a bigger and better pipeline, and how to create modular environments for local development all the way through production.

The observations about weak  Diffie-Hellman cryptography this weak point to real-world issues with everything from HTTPS to SSH. This post covers the details of how to configure a number of different common tools correctly.

I included an interesting survey on ethics and systems administration a while back and the results, and a presentation on the subject, have been released. Worth reading through.

Applying mathematical and statistical methods to monitoring tools has been gaining traction, this post delves into a specific case in some details.

Continuous delivery pipelines are increasingly common for web application environments, but the tools required for other environments are less-well known. This slide deck covers a real-world pipeline for a module app.

A good post covering both devops in a legacy environment, and the realisation that everything progresses to legacy over time if it’s successful. Some good discussion of planning for different lifecycles upfront.

Solid presentation from PuppetConf on using Puppet to both build and manage aspects of a Mesos/Chronos cluster.

An interesting usecase for a reusable docker container. This post covers creating a container that will generate lots of IO, great for benchmarking or testing the behaviour of a noisy neighbour.

Demonstrating that data hasn’t been tampered with is an interesting usecase which a traditional data structure might not provide. Merkle trees are interesting here and the following post does a good example of explaining them with a series of diagrams.

A nice run through of modern infrastructure tool groupings, including configuration management, container, development environments, schedulers, container operating systems and more.

Most of the posts around devops focus on software defined infrastructure, but hardware still has many places. This post covers setting up a powerful home-testing personal cloud from various custom components.

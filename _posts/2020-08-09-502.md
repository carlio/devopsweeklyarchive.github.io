Tools
=====

Open Service Mesh is a new lightweight, extensible, service mesh for dynamic microservice environments. It provides out-of-the-box observability features and uses SMI for configuration.

Sysbox is a new container runtime that makes it easier to run low-level software, like Systemd, Docker, and Kubernetes, in containers. You can run it with Docker too due to the pluggable runtimes feature.

Weâ€™re starting to see application frameworks and developer tools provide high-level abstractions for running on platforms like Kubernetes. Tye is an interesting .NET tool that eases running .NET applications on cloud native platforms.

Turandot allows for using TOSCA with Kubernetes. TOSCA provides a high-level service description aimed at portability and interoperability between underlying infrastructure.

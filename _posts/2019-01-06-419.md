Jobs

At Instana, we process and analyze millions of messages per second in order to provide actionable APM intelligence to our rapidly expanding customer base. This constant stream of telemetry creates a number of challenges that must be met with operational agility, as well as strong architecture, design and development.

We are looking for talented senior engineers who are interested in or have experience with large scale ingress platforms. An interest in improving the operability, optimization and deliverability of our platform components in Java (dropwizard, vertx) and Golang is a must. Experience with distributed data stores and queues such as Cassandra, Elasticsearch, ClickHouse and Apache Kafka is preferred.

Does this sound like you? Are you located in New Zealand, Australia, or Austin TX (we are building a team to ensure on call impact to life work balance is nil)? Then come work for the most modern application monitoring vendor in the field!

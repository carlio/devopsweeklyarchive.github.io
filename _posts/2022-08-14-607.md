Several long reads this week, and several posts with a bit of historical context; on Java, devops and CI services. Some excellent posts too on practical operations topics; incident management with chat, delivery lead time metrics and more.


StackHawk sponsors Devops Weekly
============================

The new StackHawk and GitHub CodeQL integration helps developers easily find, prioritize, and fix vulnerabilities every time they check in code! Tune into the webinar to see how it's done Tuesday, 16th August @ 10am PT.

News
====

A post on using a delivery lead time metric in practice. Lots of theory around this topic, so very useful to see more practical content on how itâ€™s being implemented.

A question I see lots of teams answer differently. Who should write Terraform? Fundamentally this turns into a question of whether to centralise or distribute, via a quick devops history.

An excellent post, breaking down an incident related to Kubernetes health checks, with some good takeaways.

How do you approach incident management when you have a highly distributed architecture and many teams? Many organisations I see reach for chat bots to facilitate collaboration, this post provides some nice details about one organisation's implementation.

Java is a hugely popular programming language and ecosystem, but why? This post provides a great history as well as a look at some of the work going on to make Java better for even more use cases like native apps, microservices and edge computing.

Tools
=====

Tracetest is a trace-based testing tool that leverages the data captured by your existing Open Telemetry distributed traces to produce easy to create, yet super powerful integration tests.

Another testing tool, Filibuster is a Service-level Fault Injection Testing tool. This is a technique for identifying resilience issues in microservice-based applications in development, before code ships to production.

Some good practical implementation details for anyone rolling out continuous deployment. I particularly liked the guiding principles section focused on social considerations.

I’m pretty happy to see the Open Container Initiative standards effort taking a look at a specification for container images. This post explains what and a little of the why.

I’ve been predicting an explosion of interest in container build for a while. Using the Nix build and packaging system is an interesting approach, with a number of advantages as laid out in this post.

The concept of a pipeline as the way for managing software delivery has been around for a while, but how do containers change the steps in your pipeline? This post does a good job of stepping through various options.

Another MySQL post, this one an experience report of scaling MySQL on EC2. Details of sharding strategies, migrating data, zero-downtime operations and more.

And another Kafka post, this one a tale of scaling and monitoring Kafka in production. Also includes a discussion of why Kafka makes sense for some architectures, in particular it’s  combination of high throughput and persistence.

I’ve not had chance to read the new SRE book just yet but here is a set of comprehensive notes from the book. Might be enough to interest you to buy, or decide it covers ground you are already familiar with.

Tools
=====

Airflow is a system to programmatically author, schedule and monitor data pipelines. The idea is to describe pipelines as directed acyclic graphs using Python. Airflow also comes with some great looking visualisation tools too.

Habitus is a build tool for Docker images. It builds on Dockerfile, allowing for multi-stage builds as well as simple secrets management and environment variable injection.

Napalm, or Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support, is a suite of tools for driving network devices with code, in this case Python. SUpport is already impressive, with JunOS, EOS, NXOS, IOS and more on the list.

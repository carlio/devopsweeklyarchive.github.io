Observability, DORA metrics, automating SLO management, setting policies for Git repos and more. We’re also starting to see the return of events, with WTF is SRE back this coming week.


StackHawk sponsors Devops Weekly
============================

Confused by the different types of security testing you can put in your pipeline? You're not alone. Watch StackHawk Co-Founder Scott Gerlach break down the different types of tools you can use to automate API and Application Security testing.

News
====

A super interesting post on SLO management at scale, using a Git repository as a system of record, defining an internal schema and then building tooling and a developer-friendly workflow around the results.

A discussion of using the DORA metrics to aid decision making in a large software organisation. Love seeing examples of the application of this work in the real world.

I’d skip most of the meta naming conversation, but considering security and security teams is an important part of adopting devops practices, and this post has lots of tips and observations about why that’s so important.

Another post in this interesting series, looking at systems reliability and what we can learn from space technology.

When administering any software, it’s useful to have an interactive tool to help understand what’s happening. Nats-top is (unsurprisingly) top for Nats and this post shows why it’s useful for real-time monitoring.

Tools
=====

I’m a big fan of Open Policy Agent, mainly because of the wide range of use cases it can be applied to. Reposaur is a useful tool for writing policy against GitHub repository metadata, with some handy built-in functions.

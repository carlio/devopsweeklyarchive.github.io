I’m really looking forward to the Operability conference (mentioned below) later in the year as it promises to mix new and emerging tech with talks about actual operations, service management, IT, etc. It’s great to see these topics get there own conference alongside the more tech and community focused events. Hopefully see a few readers there.

Moving past issuing an alert for every state change in your monitoring system can take some doing in some environments. This post does a good job of going through the different reasons to page someone.

A good, practical, Docker experience report covering image layout, image building, automation, logging, managing configuration and more.

The number of different monitoring tools is growing by the week. Monitoringscale looks like a nice attempt to catalogue all of them. Everything from brand new SaaS and open source tools all the way to Tivoli.

The IEEE are looking to produce a special issue of IEEE Software focused on the software-engineering challenges of adopting DevOps practices. They have a call for articles out with a deadline of October, and publication next year. The list of suggested topics should help anyone thinking of submitting.

A nice run-through of the tradeoffs of adopting containers when it comes to isolation. In short - don’t just treat them like virtual machines but understand the new capabilities and risks.

A nice reminder that Devops is intertwined with agile practices, and in many cases those core agile practices are not well understood or adopted. This tallies with my own experience too.

A nice, quick, personal opinion comparing Jenkins to Rundeck for the web based command and control frontend. I definitely agree with the conclusion that we should see more tools in this space.

A good interview from the recent Craft conference in Budapest, all about logs as a fundamental part of a data processing infrastructure, as well as some talk of the importance of event sourcing and CRDTs.

Fan Networking is an interesting idea to expand IPv4 network space in a local network by using an underlay network. The fan is a mapping between a smaller network address space (typically a /16 network) and a larger one (typically a /8), the site has examples using AWS VPC and Docker.

A useful site on how and why to keep a changelog for your software projects. I’m not always good at this so hopefully a useful reminder for others too.

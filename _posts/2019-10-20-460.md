Testing for security alongside testing for functionality isn’t a new idea, although it’s only now becoming more popular. This post (written by yours truly) looks at the different tradeoffs involved in deciding where in the SDLC to test, based on feedback, coverage and cost.

Some interesting thoughts on both the importance of infrastructure as code and its potential evolution into higher-level reusable architecture components.

A quick shout out to say the 10 year Devopsdays anniversary event is coming up, at the end of October in Ghent. The term devops was coined for the very first event, and 10 years seems something of a milestone.

=======================

Machine learning is already being used in many DevOps processes – driving highly efficient workflows across the entire software delivery lifecycle. See how machine learning is currently being used to improve incident management and response in production environments:

News
====

SSH is still the ubiquitous solution to remote management, and most of those use public keys to authenticate. This post argues we’ve collectively got this wrong, and the user experience and security when using SSH certificates is much superior.

An interesting presentation on instrumenting your applications, covering consuming instrumentation, writing code that is easy to instrument and writing the instrumentation itself.

I’ve been experimenting with Octant recently, which is a new Kubernetes dashboard with lots of functionality built-in as well as a nifty plugin mechanism. This post is a good introduction.

The latest Accelerate State of Devops report is out, featuring insights about how organisations are using cloud, models for improving organisational performance and lots of data about devops adoption.

A useful post on security-minded code review for Kubernetes applications and configuration, featuring a checklist of things you should be considering when looking at third party code in particular.

Distributed tracing is still a new concept to lots of folks, and this post does a great job of introducing tracing from the basics, and explains the various terms from scratch.

Open Standards are just as important as Open Source, and projects like Open Telemetry are good examples of making software more compatible. This post covers some recent news about existing agents adopting Open Telemetry.

Observations about new Serverless frameworks running on top of KUbernetes, in particular at CloudState which builds on Knative and focuses on stateful services.

Helm 3 is nearing release, and resolves lots of the concerns folks had about Helm 2, as well as adding some useful new capabilities. This post covers how to migrate to the new version given the old Tiller controller is no more.

How we organise work often has an impact on the work we deliver. This epic post looks at outcomes vs outputs, local vs global optimisation and several other antipatterns when looking to most more quickly in the right direction.

Always interesting to see experience reports from Devopsdays events. My experience is some of these points are quite local, but some useful observations about what folks are talking and thinking about at the moment.

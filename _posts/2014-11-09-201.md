I always like it went I have content for the newsletter that I could put under the titles culture, automation, measurement and sharing and this issues is definitely one of them. Inclusivity in our community, windows packaging, sensu/graphite integration and case studies from enterprises using devops practices.

Chocolatey is the alternative windows package store. It’s basically Yum for Windows, and is especially handy for installing developer tools and software. This Kickstarter is raising money for the open source effort to make it even better.

There's lots of interest in new low level programming languages for systems work at the moment, so this post might be of interest. It’s a brief comparison between Rust and Go, picking up on some of the nice features in both.

It’s really important in my view to keep making the growing devops community as inclusive as possible. This post, with observations of from Devopsdays in Gent, should remind everyone that The first rule of devops club is welcome to the club.

As we increasingly rely on our build pipelines for feedback, the job of managing a large build system becomes harder and more interesting. Here’s a good presentation about infrastructure as code for build engineering.

Init systems are still trickier to use that they probably should be. Here’s a useful tutorial on preventing detached processes with upstart and systemd.

Sensu is doing a good job of not reinventing the wheel when it comes to things handled well by other software. Here’s a nice example of sharing event data between Sensu and Graphite.

Some interesting ideas about a reference architecture for treating your platform as an application. There's probably value in formalising language around things like this, even just to make it easier to compare and have conversations.

Walter is described as a tiny deployment pipeline. IT reminds me of the wercker build file, but can run locally as well as within a CI system. Useful for testing pipelines locally.

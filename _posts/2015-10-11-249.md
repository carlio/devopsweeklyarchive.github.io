For no apparent reason I have lots of solid security content this week, from an excellent crypto for developers post through presentations and new interesting looking scanning tools. Throw in some warnings about jumping into microservices too quickly and a mix of other posts and hopefully something for everyone.

It’s incredibly easy to get basic security wrong, and cryptography is probably even easier to misunderstand. This post is a superb introduction to crypto for developers, worth reading even if you think you know the subject well.

I failed to mention the Otto and Nomad releases from Hashiconf last week. Here’s a nice writeup of a first look. For those that missed it, Nomad is a new multi-host container sheduler and Otto is an opinionated workflow tool which covers both local development and production deployment.

A solid introduction to why securing infrastructure is hard and a good collection of things you can do, including bounties, paying attention to attackers, auditing everything and more.

A great post showing the differences between how Graphite and InfluxDB work, and how you can configure things to move data from Graphite to Influx.

A post asking how much of the current buzz around microservices is simple people cargo-culting. Makes some good points that will probably be ignored unfortunately.

Programmable Infrastructure is a new site detailing tools but more interesting patterns for modern infrastructure. Some solid early guides on load balancing and service discovery.

Managing an AWS installation, especially as an organisation grows or where many people have access, can be a challenge. This post covers cleaning up instance snapshots using the python boto library.

A solid list of antipatterns for adopting service based architectures, covering the need for automation, depending on client signoff, gateways, versioning and more. Not sure I agree with everything, but the real-world story-telling style is great.

An interesting post from a team that asked the question “what would our infrastructure look like if we designed it today”.

Tools
=====

Gryffin is a security scanning tool out of Yahoo that’s aimed to work at scale. The deduplication of tests sounds very useful for getting results quickly with testing identical pages.

Syntribos is another security scanner, but one specifically geared not to HTML and web pages, but to testing APIs.
<br>[https://github.com/rackerlabs/syntribos](https://github.com/rackerlabs/syntribos)


A nice little dashboard that shows the number of commits on a repo since the last deploy. Surfacing this information can help avoid large deploys later.

[eBook] 7 Performance Metrics to Release Better Software, Faster

Get real-life examples of application failures and how to avoid them by using 7 key metrics to find problems early on. Also, learn how stuff really works in “the life of a metric” and how to integrate performance metrics into automation tools throughout your application delivery chain.

News
====

Our ability to understand the systems we’re tasked with managing diminishes as their scale and interdependence increases, and blaming individuals for failure ignores the opportunity to learn from issues. A very well reasoned article on learning from failure.

The first Kubecon conference was held this last week, with lots of good talks and discussions. These two posts provide a good summary, along with links to some of the presentations.

Nice ideas around a deployment contracts, specifying the requirements on the infrastructure a team might have at different points during the development process, as an application heads towards production.

Windows is becoming increasingly friendly to developers more familiar with a unix-like environment. This post shows how to combine the excellent cmder shell with the Atom editor.

A great write-up of the recent Devops Enterprise conference, with brief notes and lots of links to the presentations from the conference.

A detailed look at why monitoring containers is both different and difficult for traditional tools. A pretty good introduction to Linux containers even if you’re not interested in the monitoring angle.

A nice example, with lots of code samples, of using an intermediary docker container as part of a build process - in this case for a Haskell based application.

This next post introduces the home-grown platform as a service, Paasta, based on a tight integration between Mesos, Marathon, Docker and Sensu. The post introduces a high-level application description format and steps through the system in use.

Obviously a topic close to my heart, but an interesting post on the fallacy of Containers vs. Configuration Management. Some good observations of the strengths of both sets of tooling.

A great tale of jumping into an open source community, in this ase around the Sensu monitoring framework. Lots of hints and tips for anyone using Sensu too.

A good explanation of the Redis security policy (of not providing built-in features). Includes a demonstration of compromising a host based on an unprotected redis instance and a nice discussion of the various tradeoffs when writing network software.

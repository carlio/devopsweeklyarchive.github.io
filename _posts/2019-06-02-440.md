======================

See how adopting DevOps and SRE methodologies can lead to faster and more reliable deployments. In the free eBook, Creating a Culture of Reliability, VictorOps talks about exactly how and why they implemented their own SRE and DevOps practices:

News
====

A good post on what it takes to adopt CI/CD practices, looking at build and release engineering, monitoring, testing and more.

A series of posts covering a set of design principles for building secure modern systems. The set of anti-patterns in particular makes for interesting reading for anyone interested in system design.

A detailed post on the importance of production excellence. Why simply giving folks the keys to production isn’t enough, and why various aspects of operations are essential for high-quality systems.

An interesting look at a new configuration tool with an interactive CLI tool vs more file management. Based on some survey research which has some interesting questions too.

A post partly about the AWS SQS service, but more about why queuing systems are at the heart of building scalable architectures.

Kind is a tool designed for testing other Kubernetes tools. It makes it trivial to spin up ephemeral clusters on top of Docker. This post uses Kind with a simple Makefile to build a simple provisioning tool.

A comparison of some aspects of the AWS and Azure serverless offerings. Looking at the differences in pricing, language support, deployment options and state management amongst other areas.

Tools
====

Kui is described as a hybrid CLI/UI development experience for cloud-native applications. It provides similar functionality to parts of kubectl, but combines a terminal with rich GUI output as well. Interesting tool and a novel user interface.

Homebrew is a popular package manager for macOS. Homebrew Bundle provides a way of describing in a single file all the desired packages, and then installing them in one command. Handy for sharing dependencies between machines.

High-level Kubernetes tooling has often been restricted to Go, so it’s nice to see tools like kopf appearing. Kopf is a Python library for writing Kubernetes operators, with a simple API and lots of examples.

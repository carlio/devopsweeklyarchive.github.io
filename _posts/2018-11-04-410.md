I spent a few days last week at Velocity in London, and saw lots of interesting talks. These two posts covers a large number of the sessions and keynotes, with detailed notes and shots of some of the slides.

Another Velocity talk, this one from me, on advanced image build patterns with Docker. Looking beyond just features to ways of using multi-stage builds and other image tooling to create maintainable images.

gRPC is increasingly popular for inter-service communications, but a new technology comes with new error conditions. This post walks through investigating a gRPC error, and has some recommendations for anyone adopting the technology.

Another gRPC related post, this one looking at gRPC-web, which uses the Envoy proxy to convert requests from a client (say a web browser) into HTTP/2 gRPC calls to the backend.

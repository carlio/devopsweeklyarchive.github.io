A great talk on security theatre. Good quotes on helping shift responsibilities earlier in the development process and good observations about the changing role of security teams.

An interesting paper on quality metrics for infrastructure as code. Looking specifically at Ansible, but intended to be generalised.

Lots of people have written about tracing, but this post looks at some of the implementation challenges, from libraries and sampling to data transfer and storage.

Tools
=====

Akri lets you easily expose heterogeneous devices (such as IP cameras and USB devices) as resources in a Kubernetes cluster, while also supporting the exposure of embedded hardware resources such as GPUs and FPGAs.

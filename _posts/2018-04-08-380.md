News
====

As part of the Kubernetes Application Definitions working group, and the Apps Special Interest Group, we’re running a survey to find out how people are deploying applications to Kubernetes. If you’re already using Kubernetes please take 10 minutes to help us understand the current landscape of tools and practices.

As Kubernetes becomes more popular for running applications the development tooling is starting to get better too. This post explores a few of the current tools for building apps for Kubernetes.

Feature flags are a powerful tool but can become unwieldy in practice. This post explores a few ways of managing flag debt; from integrating with issue trackers, expiring flags and limiting the number of flags.

If you’re managing PostgreSQL you’re probably familiar with the process of vacuuming. This post explores how monitoring a few key PostgreSQL metrics and events will help you ensure that vacuum processes are proceeding as expected.

Continuous deployment of stateless applications is much easier to manage that those with data. Part of the challenge involves managing schema changes in an automatic fashion. This post explores why database deploys should be decoupled from application changes.

A post on why trying to identify a single root cause for a failure in a complex system is limiting to trying to to prevent future failures.

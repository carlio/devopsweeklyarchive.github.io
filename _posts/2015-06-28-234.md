The Open Container Project is a lightweight, open governance structure, to be formed under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime.

If you’re wondering what the above means then you might be interested in looking at runc. It’s a lightweight container runtime, basically just the core of Docker plus some additional contributed features. runc can be embedded into other systems easily, and doesn’t require a daemon of any kind.

A good high-level opinion piece about the above mentioned open container format. If you’re just catching up or more interested in the big picture than the technical details worth reading.

Mesos, and it’s accompanying frameworks, is a powerful tool. That can mean trying it out is a barrier to entry. This posts shows how to create a simple local sandbox to solve that problem using docker and compose.

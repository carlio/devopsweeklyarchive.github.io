A look at the security profile operator for Kubernetes. This exposes a first-class interface for configuring seccomp profiles amongst other useful features including exposing metrics and enriching logs.

The first two parts of a series on building an analytics platform based on Druid. Background on technology choice and lots of technical details about the implementation.

A post looking at the role of an SRE team in adopting observability tooling. A lot of this depends, in my experience, on the reality on the ground of roles vs the titles.

Events
======

Kubernetes Community Days UK is coming up on the 15th and 16th September. A virtual event over 2 days, with talks on supply chain security, secrets, scaling, getting started with Kubernetes and lots more.

Tools
=====

There is so much interesting information in Git and GitHub metadata. Askgit is a CLI tool for exposing that data via a SQL interface to make it easier to use.

Monika is a nice and simple monitoring tool. Define probes for URLs in a config file, what failure looks like and how you want to be notified of any issues. It also supports Postman and HAR files as input.

title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#222 - 5th April 2015 
date: 2015-04-05T12:42:31+01:00
---

A pretty packed issue this week, if there is a theme it would be balancing adopting new technologies against tried and trusted approaches: with a few practical docker posts, discussion of choosing boring technology alongside more talk of unikernels.

It’s also your last chance to fill in the Devops Survey which closes on April 10th. The more people fill this in the more useful the results should be. [https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1984283/4b0ea1afb087](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1984283/4b0ea1afb087)

Viewing containers as just another packaging format leads you to miss the typical metadata available to tools like apt and yum. This post demonstrates a clever approach to fixing this problem, making containers much less of a black box.

MirageOS and more generally unikernels are an interesting potential future. These two posts demonstrate a simple deployment mechanism, and look at what future unikernel infrastructure might allow us to do.

I’ve always found choosing technology interesting, how, if and when to adopt newer technology is very contextual and knowing whether you got it right takes time. This post does a great job of both telling a story but also providing ideas for how to go about technology choice.

A great rundown of some of the tools and capabilities available when building mobile applications and adopting devops practices.

One of the things that came out of Chef conf (if you were there please send me links to things you found interesting) this week that I particularly liked was this take on describing some of the principals of Devops, taking a steer from the idea of a school of Kung Fu.

A pretty indepth walkthrough a data intensive system, with talk of read/write tradeoffs, partitioning, sharding, hardware selection and lots more.

A post for anyone breaking down systems and teams, whether coming from a microservices or devops point of view. It focuses on the importance of configuration management debt as the first step in changing a large system.

A good post on one of the advantages of using containers, that of improving utilisation and reducing costs, by making multi-tenant systems easier. It doesn’t touch on the increased network complexity in those situations but covers lots of other good points.

A good call to action for security teams to adopt devops practices, highlighting some interesting data from a recent survey that shows security as a primary concern when adopting devops, but also that it’s happening anyway.

Events

Docker is awesome but doesn't come with batteries included; once you go beyond the basics you'll be searching the web for insights and having to decide between the old/new/hottest approach to do things. Pragmatic Docker is an event on April 21st in Belgium on what works today with only a brief focus on glimpses of the future.

For a limited time if you the code WE-ALL-LOVE-DEVOPS-WEEKLY you’ll get 50% off the ticket price.

Tools
=====

As containers become the unit of work in distributed systems, scheduling across hosts becomes increasingly important. Citadel is interesting because, rather than being just an out of the box solution it’s positioned as a toolkit for writing your own custom schedulers.

Shpec is an rspec-like testing framework for shell scripts. The README gives you an idea of the syntax, and show how easy it is to extend with your own matchers.

A simple Rake library which allows building Debian packages using either git-buildpackage or fpm. It would be nice if this supported other package types like RPM as well.

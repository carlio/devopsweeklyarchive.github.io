A post on using preemptible nodes on GCP. These are unreliable by design, so implementing chaos engineering approaches is even more critical.

Tools
=====

ConsoleMe is a web service that aims to make AWS IAM permissions and credential management easier for end-users and cloud administrators.

Early, but very interesting. Zellij is on the surface just another terminal multiplexer. But it’s webassembly plugin system and plans for a browser based interface look interfacing for sharing reusable UIs.

Qovery is a high-level cloud application platform. It provides an interface based around Git and branches but deploys to your cloud environment, supporting AWS, Azure and GCP.

Libyear is an interesting idea for tracking dependency freshness. It’s a single number that can be aggregated in different ways to make comparison easier.

Git is the de facto choice for version control, and it’s used by everything from small projects with a single maintainer up to huge projects like Kubernetes. This post looks at some of the challenges at Kubernetes scale.

Discussion of using stacked pull requests in Git. Keeping individual PRs small, but chaining them with dependencies on each other. The post doesn’t discuss this pattern in slower moving or more async environments though.

A project tracking the (incredibly rare) breaking changes in the AWS API. Most of these are deprecation and then removal of features, rather than just breaking the APIs, which is credit to AWS’s approach here.

AI-Powered DevOps: Injecting Speed & Quality Across Verizon’s Cloud Pipelines

With customer experience being a top priority, Verizon turned to an automated delivery pipeline approach that leveraged cloud and container technology. This enabled teams to deploy new features faster, directly into production. But it also increased technical complexity. Learn how Verizon used Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered monitoring, and was able to transcend this problem, and today easily manages complex, web-scale DevOps in the cloud.

News
====

I’ve been experimenting with the CUE language for configuration and have started writing a few posts. CUE nicely combines declaratie syntax, built-in templating and validation and a local scripting language.

Tools
====

Grit copies commits from a source repository to a destination repository. It is intended to mirror projects residing in a private monorepo to an external project-specific Git repository.

Response is an application designed to make incident response easier. It provides a Slack application which allows for reporting incidents and tracking who is dealing with them and where.

K3d provides a simple way of running the k3s Kubernetes distribution on top of Docker. Ideal for local development and for standing up ephemeral Kubernetes clusters for testing.

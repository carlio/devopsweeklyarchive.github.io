Tools
=====

Lots of Cloud providers are now providing a Kubernetes-as-a-service, but provisioning requires different API calls and configuration. Kubeformation aims to abstract away some of that, providing a declarative configuration file and compatibility with different services.

It’s common practice to lint source code, to catch style or common programming errors. Prose lint adds another useful capability to that list, linting the written word. I’d love to see this used to improve READMEs in lots of projects.

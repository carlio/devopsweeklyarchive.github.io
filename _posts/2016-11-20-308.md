title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#308 - 20th November 2016 
date: 2016-11-20T14:59:57+00:00

Two sets of presentations from two very different conferences (KubeCon and DevSecCon) this week, all published within a week or so of the event and free for everyone to watch and read. The fact this is becoming the norm means a pretty amazing learning resource exists for even the latest technology or thinking. Good job conference folks.

A look at some of the data and observsations from the recent swarm3k experiment in running a reasonably large Docker Swarm cluster. Lots of graphs and interesting analysis.

If you want to understand system programming then it’s useful to have a good understanding of what’s happening at the kernel level and with syscalls. The tutorial (part of a series) explains how to write your own syscall.

Some good tips for anyone building Docker images and looking to reduce the size of the resulting image.

A look at using Docker to build container images and then exporting the resulting filesystem, which can then be run under systemd-nspawn. The usecase here is for desktop software but it’s an interesting workflow for other situations as well.

Tools
=====

Storing credentials in your shell profile and exporting them as environment variables is incredibly handy but very insecure. Envchain looks to provide the same ease of use but to use  OS X Keychain or gnome-keyring as the backing service.

Pinpoint is an open source Application Performance Management tool for large-scale distributed systems. It features some tracing capabilities, the various screenshots give a good sense of its capabilities.

IronFunctions is an open source serverless platform which supports running Docker images via a simple API. It’s quite early but the documentation walks you through how to try it out quickly.

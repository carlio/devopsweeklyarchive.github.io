Tools
=====

ctlptl aims to make it easier to grab an ephemeral, local, Kubernetes cluster for development purposes. Rather than competing with Docker Desktop, KIND, Minikube or similar tools it provides a higher-level user interface.

Athenz is a platform for X.509 certificate based service authentication and fine grained access control in dynamic infrastructures. It supports provisioning and configuration (centralized authorization) use cases as well as serving/runtime (decentralized authorization) use cases.

With KubeCon finishing up this last week we have a fair amount of Kubernetes news this week, but if thatâ€™s not your thing look out for some good posts on embracing collaboration when it comes to security teams, not blaming workarounds for problems and some great learning material for distributed systems topics.


StackHawk sponsors Devops Weekly
============================

The shift to rapid, frequent deployments over the past decade initially left application security behind. Modern AppSec belongs in the CI/CD pipeline.

News
====

Workarounds might be inevitable in complex people and computer systems, how can we identify and remove the need for workarounds that lead to security problems?

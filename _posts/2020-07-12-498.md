env0 sponsors Devops Weekly
========================

Using your existing Infrastructure as Code, it’s easy to get rid of your traditional staging environments and start using a dynamic, dedicated environment for each pull request.  Avner (one of the devs from the env0 team) put together a blog post on how per-pull request environments will help shorten feedback loops, reduce bottlenecks and conflicts, and increase your team’s velocity. Plus how to get started with them.

I mentioned Vector last week in the tools section. Anyone interested in a new monitoring tool should find this post interesting. Basic installation and usage instructions, and some observations about design choices.

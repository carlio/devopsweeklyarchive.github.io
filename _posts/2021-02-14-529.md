Open source software has been an important part of the devops story. This paper explores some of the recent conversations about licensing, ethics and the issues with open communities.

Tools
=====

I’m a big fan of making it possible to experiment and learn with even complex platforms locally. Knative on Kind (Konk) does just that for Knative.

A simple but handy utility to resize EBS volumes on AWS.

Another useful utility, SecretScanner does exactly what you’d think, finding secrets from file systems or container images.

Monorepos appear particularly popular with some JavaScript communities. Rush is a new toolkit helping to build and publish many packages from a common Git repo.

It’s the weekend before KubeCon, which means the next issue just might have far too much Kubernetes content for some folks. Fair warning. This issue we have discussions of pipelines as code, runbooks, resilience engineering, insecure development environments and more.

An interesting talk looking at service mesh capabilities and in particularly how much of the functionality already resides inside Kubernetes. Some good thoughts about the future direction of the platform too.

As you become more of an advanced user of Kubernetes it’s common to want to write your own controllers. This post explores building a controller using Buck, and integrating it with Brigade and Porter and other component tools.

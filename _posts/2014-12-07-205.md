News
====

Ezra Zygmuntowicz passed away this last week. Not everyone will know of him, but lots of you will have been influenced by his work. This is a lovely reminder of some of that work, and a call to support others in our community striving to build things.

I don’t normally feature things purely because they’re funny, but the combination of the Puppet documentation, the works of H.P. Lovecraft and a Markov generator made me laugh quite a lot this week.

It’s the first week of December which means at least one thing, it’s time for SysAdvent again. A great community affair, so far we’ve had posts on Docker; Sysdig, osquery and facter; Debuggers, Kafka and more.

Whatever the project, providing good quality documentation is essential. This new section of Write the docs is a great starting point for anyone wanting to improve project documentation.

An interesting presentation investigating using Riemann, InfluxDB and Grafana in place of Graphite for time series monitoring.

One of the problems you quickly run into if you try and run more than one process in a container is that the main init system is unlikely to work as expected. This post is a good introduction to one solution using the S6 init system.

Some interesting and useful data from a recent survey relating to being on-call. Details about the impact of monitoring and automation tools, average rotation times, communication during incidents and more.

When talking about the latest tools is easy to forget that lots of people are just getting started. Especially if you work for a small company getting over early hurdles can be pretty painful. This next post is a nice introduction to the basics of deployment.

One of the things that came up a few times at the recent New Directions in Operating Systems conference was the Rump Kernel. This post does a nice job of introducing the basics and providing a few links for more information.

Another post from the New Directions in Operating Systems conference, this time delving into one of the other recurring themes; the end of the general purpose OS. Includes some details of the DIOS research project.

And a final related bit of content from the New Directions conference, this paper, entitled Unikernels: Rise of the Virtual Library Operating System, covers what Unikernels are and why they might solve some of our problems around light-weight operating systems and large attack surfaces.

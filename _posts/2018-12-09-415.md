Just arriving in Seattle with 8000 others for KubeCon and CloudNativeCon. The only problem is likely to be keeping up with all the context and announcements. If you don’t like Kubernetes you might want to skip next week’s issue.

News
====

Something I’ve been working on recently, along with folks from Microsoft and other tech companies. Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) is a specification for a general packaging format for multi-service (and multi-toolchain) applications.

[https://cnab.io/](https://cnab.io/)


The CNAB spec is pretty low-level. Conversely Docker App is a high-level user-facing tool for parameterising and sharing Compose based applications, including for Kubernetes. It implements the CNAB spec under the hood, which opens up signing and all-in-one bundles and compatibility with other supporting tools.

A nice write-up of solving a scaling problem by distributing work across multiple machines, looking at features flags to roll out and a service discovery and locking mechanism to ensure certain characteristics.

It’s one thing to setup a CI system, but how do you get development teams to adopt it? This post looks at providing a higher-level DSL which makes reuse across teams using similar technologies much easier.

Two posts that provide both a good overview of the ActiveMQ architecture and a deep dive into collecting useful operational metrics from a running instance.

A set of slides on the evolution of devops. Some reading between the lines required but lots of great reading recommendations and a reminder that devopsdays (and devops in general) is an amazing story of people sharing and helping others.

A good slide deck looking at building a continuous delivery pipeline with Docker for Java applications. Some general best practices and some specific advice for Java developers.

Tools

Crossplane is an open source multicloud control plane. It introduces workload and resource abstractions on-top of existing managed services that enables a high degree of workload portability across cloud providers. It provides primitives for Azure, AWS and GCP out of the box and an API based on Kubernetes.

JL is a nice, small, tool for working with structured logs in JSON. It provides a nice human-friendly output when logs are piped through JL.

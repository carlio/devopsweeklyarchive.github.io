Some great longer reads this week on cloud migration, architecture and security engineering teams working more closely with development organisations. Plus several interesting tools and tech discussions.

News
====

A solid architecture post on a large scale compute platform that aims to combine the best aspects of microservices with asynchronous workflows and serverless functions. Combines migration, design, future thoughts and more.

3 interesting observations about adopting public cloud when coming from traditional infrastructure; the cloud has its own CMDB, the only thing that knows about a thing is itself, and the advantage of cloud is flexibility.

A great post on devops and security, from the security engineering perspective. Some good practical tips including embedding security engineers in engineering teams (and vice versa), gamification and more.

Argo introduces some interesting higher-level concepts into Kubernetes, including AppProject which allows for a project container to tie together other resources.

Containers are for stateless services, or so the tale goes. In reality lots of people are running databases in containers. This post, focused on PostgreSQL, makes the case that the benefits often outweigh the disadvantages.

A couple of handy posts on how to monitor AWS Fargate. What metrics should you be interested in, and how can you best access them?

I like arguments against the zeitgeist, like this post on scaling issues with GitOps. I think there are some assumptions here that, if you are are building for scale you can address with automation, or are fundamental to scale rather than the approach, but I like the debate.

Cloud migration in large, complex organisations is invariably a lot more complicated that it might first appear, partly because it’s as much about people and structures as technology. Some good observations along those lines in this next post.

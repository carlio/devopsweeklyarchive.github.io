A great post on starting to learn about operations from the point of view of a software developer.

A good discussion of the changing role of operations. It focuses solely on the operations engineering side which is a personal bugbear but otherwise makes some great points about the readiness of development teams.

SysAdvent is back. This is a month long blog post series from many authors, and the organisers are looking for article ideas and people to act as editors. They are particularly looking for new voices too.

VictorOps (who also kindly sponsor this newsletter) are conducting the 3rd annual State of On Call survey at the moment. On call experiences regularly feature in this newsletter, and how they are changing with all the new technology is a worthy research topic.

Adopting IaaS in a large, complex environment like Government comes with a certain resistance to change. This post delves into several areas and provides some good tips on architecture, understanding compliance and information security risk, exposing services accidentally, access control, cost management and more.

A good general introduction to serverless which turns into an in-depth look at how serverless changes various aspects of security including deployment, attack detection, software supply chain and more.

Docker shipped the InfraKit library a few weeks back, which is described as a toolkit for creating and managing declarative, self-healing infrastructure. This post covers a simple hello world example of getting it up and running.

A quick introduction to unikernels, showing how to build a Java application using the OSv Capstan tool and how to run the resulting unikernel on KVM.

Jobs
====

iWeb is looking for a Devops engineer to join our 23 strong team in Stafford. iWeb have been developing eCommerce websites since 1995, and now work pretty much exclusively in Magento and Wordpress. We’re after another Devop to come in and assist with owning our real estate of Ubuntu based LAMP hosting. We’re fans of Ansible and Python to ensure consistent configuration management and deployment. Understanding a PHP application like Magento would be advantageous to be able to assist with debugging and supporting the dev team, but not critical.

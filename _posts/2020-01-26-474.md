Lots of build posts this week, on new build tools, developer framework integration and the security of build servers. Plus operations lessons, devops reading and the shift from infrastructure to application and product teams.

=======================

Continuous improvement, delivery, and integration typically sit at the forefront of DevOps. But, none of this is possible without a successful system for continuous testing. See how modern teams are creating a robust continuous testing framework:

News
====

A long list of lessons learned doing operations. Light-hearted, but an awful lot to nod along to. Worth reading in particular if you’re new to ops work.

Build servers and build processes are an interesting threat vector. This talk (from one of my colleagues at DeliveryConf) looks at some of the security challenges, and discusses reproducible builds, TUF, signing, package managers and more.

An interesting look at the changes in the traditional infrastructure and operations organisation as more and more large companies adopt product teams, devops practices and cloud-native technologies.

A good post on the problems with pre-production environments and local dev environments, suggesting a move to more development activities in production.

As containers become an ever more popular distribution format, we’re seeing image build tools move from standalone tools to being build into popular frameworks as an implementation detail. The new Spring Boot release is a nice example.

Most technology decisions are a matter of choosing the best trade-offs in your context. Running on virtual machines or bare metal is definitely one of those. This post explores the question of where you might choose to run a Kubernetes cluster.

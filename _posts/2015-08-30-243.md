One of the interesting things with being around the devops community for a bunch of years is watching and listening as common practices and themes emerge. Seeing another Devops State of the Union presentation in this issue brings home how the conversations are still ongoing.

Postmortems are one of the core practices of many mature teams. This article explains in some details the what and why of running postmortems, with tips on how to run your own.

I’ve featured a few unikernel related posts in the last year and one of the topics I’ve been pondering is what operational challenges unikernels bring to the table. This post has some thoughts.

An update to the classic Devopsdays state of the union. Everything from high level meaning, via evolving patterns and practices to emerging technology.

One of the practices that has emerged along with devops is writing tests for your infrastructure. Although common in professional software development writing automated tests might still be something you need to sell inside your organisation, this post is a good starting point.

A nice list of resources for systems administrators, mainly a list of tools categorised into everything from virtualisation to editors, but also includes a few book recommendations

Bosh, often used alongside Cloud Foundry, is super powerful but also quite a departure from similar tools and takes a bit of understanding. This simple tutorial is a nice place to start.

A personal option on why ITIL and ITSM practices fail. Somewhat one sided but some good observations in there, and the comments continue the discussion.

A nice war story to accompany the above post on some of the potential failings of ITIL implementations. Optimising for change is definitely a part of adopting devops practices that’s often taken for granted in small organisations and probably the most important part in larger ones.

A video from the recent Euro Python conference focused on adopting a continuous delivery model for a typical Python application. Step by step examples using Devpi, Ansible and Jenkins.

One of the strengths of Mesos is that you can bring your own framework if the existing ones (like Chronos or Marathon) don’t fit your usecase. Fenzo is a new scheduler from Netflix and the post explains why writing a new framework made sense.

A presentation from the recent MesosCon all about using Mesos and Marathon to scale out a Jenkins installation.

Tools
=====

Hyper is described as a hypervisor agnostic docker engine. It’s able to launch tiny vms using the docker interface, providing the isolation of hardware virtualisation with the speed and user interface of containers. Very interesting.

Portus is  nice-looking user interface for the self-hosted Docker registry which also provides a team centric authorization service, so different teams can have there own namespace in the registry.

Jungle is the start of a higher-level command line interface for AWS, currently supporting EC2 and ELB services.

Gotty is a handy application which exposes a command line application as a web application. It’s surprisingly configurable too.

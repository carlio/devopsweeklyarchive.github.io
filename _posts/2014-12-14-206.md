A good intro to some of the pressures driving the move towards more cloud-based infrastructure. In particular looks at ways of optimizing costs that are available in more dynamic and pay-as-you-go infrastructures.

Sysadmin Casts provides a wide range of screencasts for those learning aspects of systems administration. From LXC, cgroups and docker to ZFS, project management and SQL injection. All told it’s now up to 41 episodes.

A nice introduction to using Consul alongside long-lived virtual machines and Puppet. Makes the point that new tools can be layered on-top of existing infrastructure without needing the big rewrite.

Tools
=====

Everyone is using Markdown it seems for writing documentation, but one thing it doesn’t provide is diagram support. Enter mermaid - generate diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.

Lambda launched at the recent AWS Re:Invent conference to lots of interest, but it takes a bit of getting started. Kappa aims to provide a workflow tool to make creating and managing Lambda functions easier.

Atlas is another tool from Netflix for managing time-series data for operations. It’s main focus is managing huge volumes (By 2014, Netflix had 1.2 billion metrics) and allowing fast queries of that huge data set.

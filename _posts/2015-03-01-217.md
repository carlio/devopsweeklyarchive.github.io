News

It’s useful, when proposing new approaches to technology, to understand the economic and business drivers behind them. This post delves into the problems with investment in the private cloud in the medium term, and why public cloud providers should win in most cases in the end.

A good post (apart from the financial analogy) focused on the benefits of using microservices to localise technical debt in rapidly growing environments.

Docker has different uses, and different programming languages sometimes benefit from different ones. This presentation delves into what containers bring to the table for Java developers.

An interesting reading list for those interested in operations. Not a technical book in sight, but lots of good books on lean, the organisation of an IT department, communication, business transformation and other culture topics.

A discussion of some of the differences between orchestration and configuration management. Some interesting points about resource usage for some auditing tasks.

A call to arms for database admins to better work with developers, and for teams to better understand where specialist skills are required when it comes to data management.

Very much from a management perspective, but a good list of traits to look for and build upon in a team.

Tools
=====

RancherOS is a minimal Linux distro designed to run Docker containers. It basically runs Docker as PID 1 a top the Linux kernel, meaning the image itself is tiny compared to a normal distribution.

Packetbeat is an open source application monitoring and packet tracing system. It works by sniffing the traffic between your application services, correlating them into transactions and using Elasticsearch for analysing them and for ad-hoc queries.

The data in AWS CloudTrail is essential for security and compliance in AWS. Traildash grabs those files, stores them in ElasticSearch, and presents a Kibana dashboard so you can analyze recent activity in your AWS account.

Burlesque is a message queue with a long polling HTTP API for easy integration. The excellent documentation gives a rundown of how to use it and the various configuration options.

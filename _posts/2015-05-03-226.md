News
====

An excellent slide deck on performance, arguing that consistent terminology is critical to a proper conversation, and showing opinionated examples.

The concept of DONE is a common one in agile methodologies, and this post makes some good points about what done looks like in teams incorporating devops practices.

A nice short introduction to service scheduling with ECS on AWS, showing the advantages of more static resource scheduling. Although I would have liked some discussion of the network constraints.

A good discussion of some of the security benefits of containers today, with comparisons to running a simple stack on a single host. The argument that containers could make tools like SELinux more approachable given explicit boundaries is particularly interesting.

A call for compliance as code to become more of a thing for those working in regulated environments. A good summary of the state of the art today and what is still open for discussion.

It’s often useful to see entire end-to-end workflows to understand how individual tools fit into real work. This example, bundling AWS, CloudFormation and Chef with a number of helpers is a good starting place.

A call to anyone building or selling monitoring software, especially involving anomaly detection, to not oversell what is possible and to talk more about how tools help skilled operations people rather than replace them.

Tools
=====

I talked about secret and key management being a common problem a few weeks back. Vault is another entrant into the space with a few nice features, including clear audit logs, rolling credentials and support for multiple storage backends.

Disque is a an in-memory, distributed job queue. Its goal is to capture the essence of the "Redis as a jobs queue" use case. Currently described as alpha quality, but interesting to keep an eye on.

CloudRouter is a Linux based full-stack SDN implementation including OpenDaylight.  It includes the features of traditional hardware routers, as well as support for emerging technologies such as containers and software-defined interconnection.

Captain is a simple opinionated workflow for building, testing and publishing containers.

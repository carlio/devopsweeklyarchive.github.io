I included the Knight Capital findings from the SEC last week, this post covers the same document but points out fundamental differences between it and what is required in a post-mortem focused on explaining what happened and preventing future occurences.

A nice post about designing your monitoring checks, focusing on context and what is important to your organisation, rather than collecting all the metrics available.

A good introduction to why companies can benefit from taking a devops approach, with 3 practices to get you started; shared environments that look like production, involving the entire team in on-call activities and automating application deployment.

An interesting open letter to the SAP community about how it can make it’s popular tools more compatible with more web-native tools. Interesting to see pressure like this on traditional enterprise software vendors.

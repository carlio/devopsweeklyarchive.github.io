Making the Switch to Bare Metal and Open Networking

By decoupling the hardware and software and disaggregating the networking solution value chain, switch hardware vendors have the ability to separately compete and innovate in hardware and software solutions. Meaning, the network is no longer restricted by legacy solutions or cross-vendor compatibility.

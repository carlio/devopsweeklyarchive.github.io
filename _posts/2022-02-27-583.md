My thoughts, like everyones, this weekend with the situation in Ukraine, and my colleagues and friends from the region. One of them shared [https://savelife.in.ua/en/](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) with me and Iâ€™m sharing here if you think you can help.

Posts on developer experience, priority/severity and continuous integration today as well, with quite a few posts on various Kubernetes goings on again this week.

People often conflate severity and priority I find. This post does a good job of explaining the difference, and why that difference is useful.

Many readers of this newsletter will be familiar with the move to encoding everything from infrastructure to database migrations and CI pipelines to security policies. This post provides a wide overview, and asks some interesting questions about the overall movement.

We often talk about developer experience, but what do we really mean by that? This post provides a description, as well as collecting together several excellent pieces on the subject.

An interesting and detailed post on the security surface for Grafana. Much of this is just as relevant to any data aggregation/data visualisation tooling.

The latest version of Helm brings to GA an interesting feature, support for publishing charts to, and consuming charts from, OCI registries.

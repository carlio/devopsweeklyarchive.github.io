News
====

A detailed discussion of the flaws of the current fad for bimodal IT. Focusing on why simply splitting IT projects into two buckets ignores the advantages of adopting more nuanced continuous delivery and devops practices.

An excellent description of a pipeline focused on application security. Good high-level of details of the why, but also lots of examples of specific tooling integration and resulting benefits.

A good set of suggestions for anyone working in a security team that wants to become more integrated with development and operations. Some good suggestions for other teams that want to break down silos too.

A few posts this week this an academic flavour; a survey looking into continuous integration practices and a collection of papers and research around resilience engineering. One of the things I’ve definitely noted over the years I’ve been curating the newsletter is the continued interest in devops topics in the academic community. It’s interesting and much appreciated.

DevOps and SRE are a behavior, not a dedicated role. See how you can build a culture of collaboration and reliability by hiring the right people to cultivate an efficient, open environment.

News
====

Docker images make use of some file system tricks to optimise storage and build caching. This post explores how union filesystems work under the hood.

Continuous integration is a common practice, but I’ve not seen much research about how people actually adopt it. This survey, part of research from the University of Sannio and the University of Zurich, is looking to gather data on the subject..

Google announced Knative last week at Google Next, a toolkit for more opinionated application and function-based workflows on top of Kubernetes. Still early but some interesting components.

The story of an evolution of a monitoring system, from Nagios and static checks to Prometheus and dynamic discovery of services.

A roundup of a recent survey looking at the adoption of serverless technologies. Some sample bias, but interesting data on language usage and prior experience with public cloud environments.

Two comprehensive blog posts on building an open source security toolchain for containers. Looking at both runtime scanning and image analysis using Sysdig Falco. Anchore and Jenkins.

There are a large number of core concepts in Kubernetes, from Pods and Services to Ingress and ConfigMaps. This blog post is a good primer for anyone just getting up to speed.

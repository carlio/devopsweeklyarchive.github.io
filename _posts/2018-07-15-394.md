News

Tickets are the universal way of approaching operations work, but have lots of downsides. Worse, their existence is rarely considered. This post looks at approaches of reducing the number of ticket queues in your organisation.

A solid post about moving from microservices to a monolithic application and a monorepo. Good arguments for the growing complexity in certain architectures.

Kubernetes is part of the the puzzle of running applications, but how do you build an effective developer workflow around it? This slide deck explores patterns and problems to solve for.

I think I disagree with the categorisation, but this post is a good exploration of some of the different approaches to platform management.

A post looking at the differences between test infrastructure and build infrastructure. I’ve definitely seen this distinction first hand with certain types of project and I think it’s a good lens through which to view certain tools.

A look at consuming the event data from GitHub for later analysis, in this case when investigating potential security issues related to source code and interaction with it.

Tools
====

XAR lets you package many files into a single self-contained executable file which makes it easy to distribute and install. Impressive examples of using this to package standalone Python applications with fast boot times.

Dragonfly looks like an interesting building block. It’s an intelligent P2P based file distribution system which aims to resolve issues related to low-efficiency, low-success rate and waste of network bandwidth in file transferring process. Useful in large-scale file distribution scenarios such as application distribution, cache distribution, log distribution and image distribution.

runq is a hypervisor-based Docker runtime based on runc to run regular Docker images in a lightweight KVM/Qemu virtual machine.

I normally read the weeks links and pick out a theme, maybe something that a number of the posts or presentations discuss. This week the topics are all over the place, another example of how broad the devops banner is at this point.

News

A good post on the ongoing enterprise devops debate, making the point that talking about application and practices that work is a good thing, and doing so with empathy for all involved is important.

If you’re running Kafka then this next post, about load testing Kafka on AWS, will definitely be essential reading. Even if you’re not the details and approach to load testing are interesting.

Wiring well behaved unix command line tools doesn’t take lots of work, but you do need to know the basics. This presentation demonstrates catching signals, dealing with stdin and stdout and more using Ruby.

Tools
=====

Boxstarter is a tool for bootstrapping a new Windows machine. It makes heavy use of Choclately packages and provides a number of very simple ways of getting started. Great documentation too.

Carbonate is a set of command line tools for managing a Graphite cluster. It packages tools for listing and finding metrics, synchronizing metrics between nodes, backfilling whisper data from other files and more.

If you’re building software on GitHub and want an easy way of managing GitHub releases then look no further than this simple command line tool. The main features are around setting release metadata and uploading binary files as part of the release.

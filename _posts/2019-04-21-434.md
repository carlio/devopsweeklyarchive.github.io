A detailed blog post on what it really takes to configure ECS and Fargate for running a container. I’ve spoken before about severless not being infrastructureless, and this post hits similar points.

The book Accelerate identifies a number of activities and metrics that are correlated with improved software delivery. This post looks at measuring those across an organisation and then using them to drive improvements.

This post looks at the distinction between the software we use to drive our testing and deployment, and the pipelines we build on top.

A look at swarming as part of the solution to incident management, with some good points about avoiding looking for a single solution to different types of problems.

A look at rolling out the envoy proxy as part of moving towards a microservices architecture communicating using gRPC.

The 2016 Devops Survey is open. For those that haven’t seen previous years this is an in-depth study into the adoption of various devops practices within organisations. The results from previous years are hugely useful to anyone promoting or encouraging devops adoption so please do take the time to fill it in this year.

Interesting overview, including looking into the technical details, of Twitter’s observability platform - focused on measurement and metrics for a complex distributed system.

Some good advice for anyone adopting devops practices. A simple set of tests focused around reducing silos, minimising hero behaviour, simplifying environments and more.

A nice review of the recent designing delivery book, with a number of important points about the applicability of system thinking to operations.

A good reminder that by using external package repositories you’re in-effect extending your network out into the internet. As shown with the recent NPM issues this probably isn’t a great idea.

A nifty approach to preventing manual configuration drift. A simple script which tags AWS instances with a ‘contaminated’ whenever someone logs in via SSH. You could then automatically reprovision those machines.

The growth of container orchestration tools has been a theme over the last year or so, with lots of momentum behind several tools and new ones emerging to compete or complement. This post delves into the relationships between some of the tools and the resulting confusion.

An interesting proposal for the NPM node repository to provide a stable snapshot with support and interoperability guarantees, akin to how RedHat provide RHEL.

A useful, if simple, checklist for anyone building websites, focusing on various security issues. It would be useful if it provided more context with each of the checklist items.

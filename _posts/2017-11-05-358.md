title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#358 - 5th November 2017

Fairly heavy on tools and architecture this week, with lots of details for anyone learning about building or running various flavours of container infrastructure. If you want a break from tools and want something a bit deeper I would highly recommend Mark’s essay on Microservices, the future of society, and all that.

A detailed essay on how we compose and decompose systems, why where we draw the boundaries between things is important, and using promise theory to make sense of this around the architecture of operations of microservice-based systems.

A solid argument that continuous delivery is a fundamental practice, while continuous deployment more of a niche concern. Useful post on definitions.

Docker announced support for Kubernetes will be coming soon, but if you’d like to try this out now it’s possible to build your own Kubernetes cluster using Linuxkit using the following step-by-step instructions.

An analysis of a recent paper on the architecture and economic impact of adopting serverless. Some useful pros and cons, as well as observations from a few case studies.

A nice presentation which acts as a good introduction to the helm package manager for Kubernetes, and Draft, a tool which makes adopting a Kubernetes and Helm workflow for your application easier.

Docker exposes a lot of performance data about running containers. This post shows how to get at it them using the CLI tools, HTTP API and underlying cgroups filesystem.

A presentation looking at serverless programme architecture, with a strong argument for functions and functional programming, and an interesting comparison of serverless components and Lisp-style functions.

This post takes a look at the common sidecar pattern for setting up a modern container network, explains why and where it’s useful, and makes the case that it’s not always the best starting place.

A comprehensive workshop for anyone learning how best to run Kubernetes on AWS. A range of exercises covering integration with AWS services as well as collected best practices.

Free Webinar: How BI & Data Science Gets Results
November 16, Online

Statistical/data science models can now run on Hadoop in a much more cost-effective manner than a few years ago. This results in fostering the convergence of traditional BI and Data Science disciplines (machine learning, artificial intelligence... etc). Join the discussion with an incredible panel including ODPi, 4C Decision, ZEPL, and Pivotal, as we'll share how this phenomenon is going to impact the Hadoop standard.

Free Webinar - Best Practices for Using Developer Tooling to Drive Operations with GitOps
November 9, Online

In this webinar, Alexis Richardson (CEO, Weaveworks) will explain how easy it is to create cloud native applications, CICD pipelines, integrate operations and more, using GitOps.

Tools
=====

Neugram is a new scripting language, based heavily on Go, but with some useful tricks to cut down on some of the syntax. It also provides a REPL and shebang support.

Psykube provides a slightly higher-level abstraction that the raw APIs for describing applications running on Kubernetes.

CIM looks like a handy tool for anyone managing AWS CloudFormation templates. Rather than try and provide an abstraction, CIM provides a number of helpful user interface tools which make working with templates easier.

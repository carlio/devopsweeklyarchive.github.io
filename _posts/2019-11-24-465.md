A post on production readiness, with a good example table of different properties (availability, performance, capacity and more) and a scale for different stages like alpha, beta and GA).

This (admittedly opinionated) post is a good description of the state of service mesh. What is it? Why should you care? What about all the hype?

A look at the changes to the AWS metadata server, in response to the recent Capital One breach. A good introduction to Server SIde Request Forgery and potential stringer mitigations too.

If you’re a Kubernetes administrator then having a powerful set of CLI tools installed can make management easier. This post looks at several powerful terminal tools.

An interesting observation on software developers and ivory tower architects. I think this applies to infrastructure and operations design too.

A post on the Kubernetes release cycle, which also covers some of the details of how the special interest group model works and the reason why the fast pace of change is a good thing.

Free Webinar - Deployment Strategies on Kubernetes
February 13, Online
[https://goo.gl/3gUvFY](https://goo.gl/3gUvFY)

Take a practical look at the different strategies to deploy an application to Kubernetes. We list the pros and cons of each strategy and define which one to adopt depending on real world examples and use cases.


Tools
=====

Lots of problems occur between development and production due to differences in data. Dotmesh aims to solve those problems by allowing you to capture, manage and share the state of your whole application using a git-like CLI tool and a central hub.

The YAML language is actually huge, with features most people don’t use or know about, some of which result in interesting security problems. SafeYaml is an interesting idea, a small subset of YAML enforced by a simple linting tool.

title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#144 - 6th October 2013

I only included one tool link last week, but I’ve found five this week from handy utilities to entire applications or core infrastructure. One thing I still like about the whole devops community is a good balance between tool making and culture/organisation change - hopefully people find this newsletter gets the balance about right.

Nice write up about developing a real time log stream processing pipeline for DNS data. Interesting choices around real time vs batch and lots of details.

A tale of starting out with a job title with the word devops and why the author changed it. Saying devops isn’t a job title isn’t enough, this is a great reason why.

There are a bunch of HTTP headers which have useful security implications, especially in modern browsers. This site lists them, provides background details and lets you check how you’re doing.

A few people (myself included) spoke at PuppetConf about wanting private classes in Puppet. This post explains a trick which gets you some of the way there now.

A good list of milestones and checklists for evolving processes based on the three ways model of devops. Good structured ways of looking at improving your organisation.

A nice tale of profiling, and using data to argue against common myths, in this case it’s always the database that’s the performance bottleneck.

lmctfy is the open source version of Google’s container stack, which provides Linux application containers. The main focus appears to be a high-level user-centric API.

Ansible provides a powerful but simple orchestration engine. Ansible shell builds upon that to provide an interactive shell for running commands, including handy things like tab completion.

Kochiku is an entire continuous integrate platform, designed for long running test suites and for distribution across many nodes. I’d love to see a Puppet/Chef and Vagrant setup for trying this out as it looks excellent.

The concept of feature flags or toggles is increasingly used for rolling out application features. Why not apply this to configuration management code too? Enter chef-whitelist.

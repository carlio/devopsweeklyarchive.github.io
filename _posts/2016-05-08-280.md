News
====

A good description of moving routing logic into the RPC layer in order to solve common problems experienced with a move towards a microservices architecture.

Lots of people reference the chaos monkey application but it does require a degree of setting up. This post demonstrates packaging chaos monkey in Docker, and then shows how to use it to test your EC2 infrastructure.

I’ve made similar arguments before, but this post does a great job of reminding folks that most system administrators have been programmers for a while, and similar roles will likely involve more code not less over time

A little artificial, but a well reasoned argument for why adopting containers is the right approach to building software today, at least from the developers point of view.

Containers tend to be used for some degree of isolation, but proper sandboxing requires unprivileged users and more. This post explains the details and demonstrates some potential solutions.

If you’ve ever wondered how syscalls work this post is for you. An excellent, detailed but highly readable look at a low level part of Illumos. Good references for anyone wanting more too.

Another of the Craft talks I enjoyed, this one about improving security by helping curate a security conscious culture. Lots of tips for how to avoid the security says No problem.

ClusterHQ are conducting a survey into container adoption. Surveys are nearly always more useful the wider the group of people who complete them - container surveys in particular tend to skew towards people using containers in my experience. Please take a moment and fill it it.

I’m a fan of using Cucumber style tests for infrastructure acceptance. The varnishtest cucumber project provides a set of steps for testing your VCL configurations, some good examples in the README.

Many organisations using the same tools adopt different workflows to accomplish similar results. This Chef plugin helps sync local cookbooks with a Chef server, based around a workflow that eschews cookbook versioning.

Monitoring is one of those recurring topics for Devops Weekly, so I’m hugely happy to see the new book The Art of Monitoring is now available. [https://www.artofmonitoring.com/.](https://www.artofmonitoring.com/.) At nearly 800 pages this should be worth reading for monitoring newbies and experts alike.

It’s not just me who things that metadata is powerful and underused when it comes to docker containers and images. This post has some ideas, a round-up of interesting usage and some new tooling.

Not a new problem, but a good description and demonstration of the perils of arbitrary code execution when installing packaging from third-party repositories.

We often talk about blameless postmortems, but this post does a good job of convincing that blame is an important part of learning and that we should strive for blame aware rather than wholly blameless.

A useful overview of the term Platform as a Service, it’s evolution and relationship to more recent trends like containers and serverless architectures.

I quite don’t agree with all the analysis, but the topic of the increasing role developers and practitioners play in the procurement process is worthy of more discussion.

Two similar posts about the serverless movement, how the name can lead to confusion (but is just a name), that it’s not the answer to everything but that the approach does have merits worth investigating.

A good article on the curl-pipe-sudo-bash installation pattern, why it exists and what problems lead to it being used.

A good reminder that monitoring is never done. I particularly liked the observation that everyone wants monitoring so they can say “it’s monitored”.

A good post explaining some of the potential in software defined networks, and a nice example of using Docker to build a powerful cloud bandwidth monitoring suite.

Metrics are an important part of adopting devops, but determining what to measure when it comes to less technical subjects is tricky. This is a good post about metrics focused around incident management and wy to measure certain things.

A talk from Monitorama last week, initially looking at what the presenter wants and doesn’t want out of a modern monitoring setup and then providing pointers to some low-level tools coming in the future.

The last of the monitorama presentations, this is an excellent talk on running a game day to help plan and simulate dealing with real production outages.

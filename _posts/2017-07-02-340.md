A fairly technology heavy issue this week, with discussion of tools to support on-call scheduling, load testing, Kubernetes management and interesting container debugging. I’ll try make next week’s issue a bit more balanced.

Just writing raw data files isn’t enough when it comes to managing systems across teams in an efficient way. This post introduces the advantages of using something like Jsonnet, in this case for managing Kubernetes configuration files.

Tools
=====

Kubeval is something I’ve been hacking on recently to validate Kubernetes config files. Especially if you’re generating those files with templates, or supporting multiple versions of Kubernetes, this might be handy.

Kube Shell is exactly what you’d expect, a shell for interacting with Kubernetes. Auto completion, command suggestion, history, inline documentation and more.

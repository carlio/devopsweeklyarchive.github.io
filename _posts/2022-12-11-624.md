News
====

A good set of common mistakes when determining useful metrics to use as part of continuous improvement. Information overload, activity bias, focusing too much on tools and more good tips.

A post on the evolution of devops practices, looking at platforms, the importance of business metrics, security and the continuing importance of culture.

A look at the work done to bring observability to Kubernetes. Not only is this useful for those running Kubernetes clusters, itâ€™s a good example of instrumenting a large complex project with OpenTelemetry.

More of an industry news post. SBOMs standards are a low level piece of the software supply chain security, but tooling is still evolving and higher level standards are still likely needed. A classic chicken and egg problem.

Probably more useful to those working on large enterprise transformation efforts, an open source maturity model from FINOS (a financial services group).

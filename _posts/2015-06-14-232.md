A strong argument for more formal supply chain management practices in continuous delivery pipelines. Lots of data to back up the main points.

A detailed interview with the SVP of Technical Operations at Etsy, talking about technology choice, understanding operational cost and the problem with the microservices/monoliths discussion.

A talk about containers in a regulated environment. The first part is a great introduction to compliance regimes in general from a developer's point of view. Also some good examples of using bats for integration testing which I’m a huge fan off.

A nice side-by-side comparison of how application deployment has changed in the last 10 years. Specifically looking at changes in operations teams, architecture and server persistence. I think the biggest missing point is release cadence.

A great talk focused on small-scale development environments and how to avoid problems when you hit production using configuration management and automated deployment tools.

A nice description of the problem Vault, and other secret servers, solve. Includes an example of Vault use for a Rails application, including a nice developer friendly interface in vault-rails.

An interesting article about adopting automation at Facebook. Lots of good stories, both about specific tasks that have been automated but also about changes to team organisation and open communication needed to make that automation work.

A look at how to use a puppet agent and master inside Docker containers, including standing up several containers using Docker Compose. Particularly useful for various testing workflows.

A nice presentation providing a simple introduction to the concept of immutable infrastructure.

An argument that, while the principles around the ITIL service management framework might still be relevant, many of the practices in place in organisations are out-of-date. A quick look at how SLAs, CMDB and change control might change with the influence of devops.

Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a way of describing various security and compliance controls. The Foreman project has just added an interesting integration, meaning you can run automated vulnerability assessment and security compliance audits across Foreman managed hosts.

News
====

Over the 8 years of Devops Weekly, YAML has become more and more common for various purposes. This post defends some of that usage while pointing out problematic usage patterns. The conclusion; YAML as data format is defensible. YAML as a programming language is not.

A detailed post on setting up an EKS cluster. It covers doing things manually as well as using eksctl. The post also dives into securing the cluster and some observability options.

A useful discussion for anyone building data processing pipelines, in particular with Kafka. It looks at whether you are best writing to Kafka first or to the database first and when which option might be suitable.

Multi-user Kubernetes clusters pose a challenge around managing who can access what. Kubernetes RBAC provides part of the solution, but you probably already have some identity service. This post explores mapping Google identities to Kubernetes RBAC to help manage access.

An interesting post on setting up infrastructure in regions (in this case Russia) with data locality laws and no large cloud provider services.

A solid argument that different software solves different problems, in this case choosing Nomad over Kubernetes when all that was needed was simple service orchestration.

An in-depth look at starting to implement serverless. Looking at the details behind several services, and some general rules and tools to help you take advantage of the ecosystem.

People invariably have strong opinions about local development environments, and what place containers have in them. This post puts forward some principles and shows an example of a Node JS based development environment.

Tools
====

JVM Profiler is a new project providing a powerful profiling tool for Java and other JVM environments, focused on distributed applications. The agent supports sending metrics to Kafka, the console or implementing a custom reporter,

Work-in-progress but useful looking. As mentioned in a post above, managing authorisation for a multi-user Kubernetes cluster can be challenging. Who-can lets you interogate who can manipulate resources on your cluster. Would make a great kubectl plugin.

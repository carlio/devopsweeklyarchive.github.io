News
====

This week saw the announcement of the Spectre and Meltdown show stopping bugs. I won’t fill the newsletter with posts on the subject, but this post from the stable kernel release manager is worth reading, and has good links to other sources too. The advice is to update your kernels, don’t delay, and don’t stop.

A detailed post on learning to operate Kubernetes, which walks through a real-world story and outlines the strategies used (which are relevant for adopting other complex software too.)

When considering architecture it’s super important to consider future changes, and often why that means not trying to solve problems you don’t have now. A good post on evolutionary architecture explains.

Brigade is a new workflow tool for Kubernetes. This post explains why the interface is a full-blown scripting language rather than just data like other tools used for some of the same purposes. A good post for anyone interested in user interface design for operations tools.

An interesting experience report from operating an application on Google App Engine. Covers the built-in functionality for GAE, but it’s also useful for anyone thinking about what changes when you run applications in any kind of restrictive platform.

With the growth of microservices we saw systems built from a range of languages. As cloud native computing grows we’re seeing a similar polyglot pattern, in particular with container and serviceless based services.

Debugging distributed systems still often comes down to looking at what’s happening at the network layer. This post provides a quick introduction to tools like dig, nc, netstat and more.

What’s the most important metric for SRE? Well, Splunk Cloud Platform SRE, Jonathan Schwietert, argues that it’s customer happiness. On Tuesday (03/17), join Splunk + VictorOps for a webinar about using SRE and observability to build customer-first applications and services:

News
====

A post (fair warning, from one of my colleagues) on the ongoing evolution of application security as cloud adoption shifts more responsibilities towards developers.

Some interesting data points from a recent survey on Serverless adoption. Everything from concerns and benefits to adoption and tooling.

A nice example of building a deployment workflow for network code, in this case with Calico. Lots of demos, including using Conftest and GitHub Actions to verify network policies and ArgoCD to deploy it.

A discussion of where the CNAB (Cloud Native Application Bundles) packaging format fits in, and how it bridges technologies to enable a more PaaS-like experience for users.

A post on the evolution of interfaces in open source infrastructure, looking mainly at Kubernetes the work done on CNI, CRI, CSI and SMI.

The Bazel build-tool has a high barrier to entry. This post is a good starting point if you’re building Go applications and outputting to container images.

A look at CIlium Cluster Mesh, including a deep-dive into eBPF and CNI networking stacks.

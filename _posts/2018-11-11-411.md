Tools
====

Applications running in Kubernetes can involve a number of pods that come and go. That makes consuming logs challenging. Kail nicely solves that with a CLI tool for watching logs from multiple pods.

Kubefwd is another handy utility for working with Kubernetes. It allows for port forwarding Kubernetes services for local development, making it easier to develop services that will co-exist in the same cluster.

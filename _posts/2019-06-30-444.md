News

Reviewing operational incidents is widely acknowledged as a good idea, but that doesn’t make them easy to conduct. This post has some observations on why.

Many things swing between centralised and decentralised as both offer different trade offs. This post explores local development environments, and why you might not need to run a full cluster on your laptop.

Threat modelling is a useful exercise for discovering likely vulnerabilities in your systems. This post provides a useful getting started guide.

A look at giving individual pods in Kubernetes access to the AWS API via IAM roles. Also explores using Open Policy Agent to ensure a secure configuration.

RISC-V is a free and open-source instruction set, opening up lots of potential for innovation at the processor level. This post explores trying out Docker on RISC-V with a local VM.

Tools
=====

Jk is a new configuration authoring tool which supports writing configuration in Typescript. This brings both a powerful language and nice type hinting in your favourite IDE.

Inlets looks like a useful tool for anyone wanting to share local development efforts with a remote audience. It’s an open source implementation of other similar tools, with docs covering how to run on a small VPS.

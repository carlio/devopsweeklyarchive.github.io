title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#145 - 13th October 2013 
date: 2013-10-13T11:32:09+01:00

Along with all the blog posts, talks and tools this issue we have lots of interesting Devops related jobs, from London to Nashville to anywhere in the world. Along with the interest in Devops has definitely come more visibility for operations jobs it seems.

News
====

The call for proposals is open for Configuration Management Camp and FOSDEM, both in Belgium at the start of February next year. If you’re part of a specific community or work with a specific tool you can propose an entire room too.

Capistrano was one of the original opinionated deployment tools that really caught on, especially in the new (at the time) Ruby on Rails community. This post covers what’s new in version 3, which has been completely re-written to be smaller, more flexible and extensible via plugins.

A good article about the perils of too much automation, and why designing systems to be operable is more important that designing software to not require operations.

A conversation at PuppetConf earlier in the year has resulted in a new site for the Puppet community, documenting the evolving best practices. Lots of useful posts collecting information from elsewhere, and a pull request model for anyone who wants to contribute.

A detailed series of blog posts describing an end-to-end automated development approach. The example uses vagrant, fabric, django and ec2 but you could replace those tools if you prefer. A nice starting point.

Another week another amazing looking Devopsdays event. The videos from the recent Tokyo event are up, covering an introduction to Sensu and lots of talk about involving the entire business in operations.

A nice write-up from the recent Devopsdays Atlanta event, covering a few of the talks and open spaces. Mainly this is a nice introduction to anyone wondering about the format of the events and how it all comes together.

An attempt to specify ten rules for collaboration between development and operations around the act of deployment. A nice idea, but a discussion about intent would probably be a good starting point.

A packed issue this week, with lots of news, events, jobs and tools - something for everyone hopefully. I’m also noticing that I’m starting to include more critiques which I’m finding increasingly a good source of opinion. If you’ve been criticising something recently write a blog post and send me a link.

Great notes from a recent talk about how Google built its datacenter network. Lots of details and observations about how the push to service based architectures fundamentally changed network requirements.

A good reminder to be wary of rushing to new techniques or tools without considering why previous approaches worked or what problems they solved. Looking specifically at potential pitfalls with microservices and container base systems.

A critique of the Dockerfile format used by docker to build images, including comments on layers, the registry and approaches to testing containers.

A good experience report of using Terraform with Azure, focusing on some of the differences between Azure and AWS and with lots of examples.

A good point on why individual log items are rarely enough when debugging a problem, and a discussion of a tool to help correlate items together.

An introduction to the rise of containers focused on the benefits to application developers. A decent run through of some of the advantages, new emerging tools and companies providing backing or support for containers.

Adopting Devops practices can be bottom up or top down or some combination of both, but without some buy in from management and without some understanding of the business goals in the development and operation team you can only go so far. Several good points on the theme of management and devops in this post.

If you’re running a web facing site or application you should be using a variety of HTTP headers aimed at making the web more secure. Based on this interesting report lots of people aren’t doing.

A good presentation about how to adopt a test driven development approach for infrastructure and operations work. Code examples as well as as discussion of strategies for implementing.

Another good presentation, this one on using CDNs as part of a security defence in depth. Lots of shoutouts to HAProxy, as wellas mention of a test suite for proxies/load balancers which is a pattern I’ve seen a few times recently. Good notes from the talk, with the video and slides at the bottom of the page.

Testing your systems with inputs designed to cause problems is a good idea, but requires a good list of bad inputs. This list of naughty strings should come in handy.

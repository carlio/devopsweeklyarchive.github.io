Devopsdays Gent
=============

Quite meta this one. It’s an ignite talk I gave at Devopsdays all about the first 200 issues of Devops Weekly. Some interesting facts and figures for the long time reader.

Probably my favourite ignite talk from Devopsdays, seeing if you can spot real statements made about devops from those generated using a Markov chain text generator.

If you’re just getting to grips with monitoring it can be difficult to know where to start. This presentation gives you a quick overview of the last 5 years. Lots of ideas for things to improve.

Another entertaining ignite talk, entitled Devops is the Macguffin. As a community we sometimes disagree on the meaning of the term Devops, but how much does that matter if we improve at what we’re doing? I couldn’t agree more.

Another of the culture focused talks, this one focused on understanding empathy from a scientific perspective.

An interesting discussion about the use of digital signatures (specifically in relation to the signing added to Docker) and why trust is hard and key management even harder.

Developer platforms, YAML!, personal development, SBOMs, serverless operations and more. No real theme this week, but several good posts on a range of technical and people topics.


StackHawk sponsors Devops Weekly
============================

News

Is focusing on developer platforms a trap? This post argues that the platform is far less important than the goal of developer enablement that teams should be focused on.

Next time someone suggests YAML as a user friendly format, please reference this post if you can’t get someone to read the YAML spec. A useful rant with great examples.

Folks often have polarised opinions on certifications. This post takes a pragmatic look at why they can be useful, but also considers the downsides. It also provides some tips for making a personal certification plan if you want to go down this route.

The interaction between policy (which is local) with the transnational open source community is always a challenge. This post looks at the cyber resilience act and why it’s important for open source.

A good reminder that serverless doesn’t mean no operations, just a change in the nature of the work. Not a new idea, but some good examples.

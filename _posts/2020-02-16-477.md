>From our sponsor, VictorOps
=======================

Host extraordinaire, Benton Rochester, talks with Gene Kim about DevOps and his excellent new book, The Unicorn Project. Don't miss this highly-anticipated episode of Ship Happens, the Splunk + VictorOps podcast:

News
====

A post on organisational friction, and getting things done where work crosses team and other boundaries. Lots of examples and a useful framing of this type of problem.

Microservices are one architectural approach, rather than the answer to all systems problems, at least according to this post on the tradeoffs and design decisions of choosing to adopt microservices.

An interesting discussion of the role of database migrations, looking at historical approaches and a new automated approach using GitHub Actions.

Most things in Kubernetes go through the API Serverer. That makes the Kubernetes audit log, which records those requests, a powerful monitoring tool. This post explores what it contains and how you can use that data effectively.

A fantastically comprehensive look at what’s new in the latest Salt release. Far more than just a list of features, the post puts new capabilities in context and shows lots of examples.

A nice migration story, moving a CI/CD pipeline from Jenkins to Concourse. Observations about improvements and expectations as well as difficulties. The fly CLI tool looks nice.

Infrastructure described with Terraform is still code, and applying programming techniques like refactoring to keep it maintainable is important. This post explains why and shows a few examples.

Another post on writing maintainable Terraform code. Lots of examples and a seet of rules around modules, data, interpolation, state and more.

This post nicely summarises why Go has made such an impact on infrastructure and cloud-based applications, outlining several of the advantages of the runtime and toolchain in particular.

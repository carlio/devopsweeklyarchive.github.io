title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#211 - 18th January 2015 
date: 2015-01-18T13:38:36+00:00

The topic of whether devops needs a manifesto arose again this week. In my view devops has always just been a word under which lots of conversations can happen. It’s pure and simple marketing (in a good way), where the product is the conversation and the community.

Applying metrics to development and operations is a core tenet of devops practices. This detailed post delves into what metrics might be a good idea for measuring information security work.

It’s not possible to run ASP.NET applications on Linux and OSX, which opens up the opportunity to run them inside docker containers. This tutorial shows you how.

Shameless self promotion. A presentation I gave about using Puppet to describe your AWS infrastructure and launch instances and manage security groups and load balancers. Also shows how to use Puppet’s unit testing tools to test your infrastructure before you launch it.

Rust is an interesting language well suited to system tools with it’s focus on type safety, memory safety, concurrency and performance. With the 1.0 release approaching here are a few good tutorials.

This post is a nice introduction to FreeBSD from the point of view of those coming from Linux. It does a good job of explaining the differences in design and approach, and is followed up by more detailed how-to posts.

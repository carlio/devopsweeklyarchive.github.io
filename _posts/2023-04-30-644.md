A look at the perils of comparing system diagrams, showing how complexity can hide in the level of detail, especially between different architecture approaches.

A post on alternatives to Dockerfile for container builds. While it talks about some of the disadvantages, it doesn’t address the advantages of Dockerfiles and why they are (still) so popular.

News
====

A detailed look at what happens as organisations adopt faster rates of change, and what that means for improving stability. Coming back to a concept of safety and the importance of fundamentally understanding the complex systems we manage.

A nice walkthrough of analysing and then shrinking the size of a Python based Docker image, reducing the size by more than 3x.

An interesting post introducing the concept of data rigidity. The post uses this to explain why, in some cases, relational databases can lead to coupling data and code, and why that’s a particularly bad fit for serverless applications.

All of the videos from the recent Devops Enterprise Summit are now available. A wide range of content, with lots of real-world case studies in large organisations.

A useful review of the current state of Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes. Explains the basic moving parts, but also brings opinions from using it and how the project is evolving with Helm 3.

A post (from a certain viewpoint) about some of the downsides of adopting specific devops practices. I think the first point about on-call is a case of local vs global optimisation. Someone suffered these problems before but because they were not part of the team it was easier to ignore.

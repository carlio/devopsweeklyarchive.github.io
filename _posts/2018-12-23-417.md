Having a full Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) setup has lots of advantages for securing infrastructure, but is typically regarded as a lot to understand. This post does a great job of explaining all the concepts, along with examples of the involved artefacts.

The State of Open Source Security Survey is open at the moment, if you’re using open source tools at all then please take a moment to complete it. I’ll post a link to the results when they’re published too.

A good list for anyone adopting devops practices. Part strategy, part tactics, this covers quite succinctly things like a maturity model and set of specific practices for evolving how an organisation runs software systems.

Lots of interest at the moment in tools to bridge the local development loop with a Kubernetes cluster. This post explores one of those tools, Tilt, and shows how it’s enabling a fast feedback loop even with the cluster in the mix.

fx is a new CLI parsing tool for JSON. Similar to jq, it supports using Javascript to write extensions and simple parsing programmes. Lots of interesting examples in this post.

A fast inner loop for developers testing out new ideas is a powerful tool, and one approach is a strong opinion about integrating frameworks, local tools and cloud services. A nice example with Spring Boot and Google Cloud Run.

Tools
=====

An experimental CLI tool for using containerd in a similar way to Docker. Not intended as a replacement as much as a place for some interesting experiments with cutting edge functionality.

OPAL is an administration layer for Open Policy Agent (OPA), detecting changes to both policy and policy data in realtime and pushing live updates to your agents.

Technical Deep Dive: Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM)
Simplify Your Data Center Operations and Workflow

Make sure your actual, physical cabling within a network matches a predefined plan. This technical deep dive will allow you the opportunity to follow along and learn. Think of it is a mini-introductory-talk-workshop kind of event.

An interesting view on the changing role of QA folks in agile development teams. Focuses on social pressures that can lead to relationships that don’t function as well as they could - just being on the same team isn’t enough.

Tools
=====

Comcast is a tool designed to simulate common network problems like latency, bandwidth restrictions, and dropped/reordered/corrupted packets. Very handy for testing distributed systems under non-ideal network conditions.

Toxiproxy is another tool for simulating network errors for testing purposes. It provides a proxy with an API, which allows for altering the network conditions cleanly. The example gives you a great idea of what’s possible.

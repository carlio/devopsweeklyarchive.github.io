A well argued opinion on how organisations can actually scale transformation efforts, making the case that methodology alone is neither necessary nor sufficient. All of this is relevant to anyone looking to devops practices in large organisations.

A good post first on why you might choose a serverless platform (in this case for a machine learning problem) and then on how to go about architecting such an application.

RabbitMQ is commonly used as a core integration technology, which makes monitoring it particularly critical. This series of posts explain what needs monitoring and how to do it.

Even with the growth of distributions and services, people are still interested in setting up Kubernetes from scratch, I presume to help build an understanding of the various moving parts. This post is up-to-date and focused on just the needed steps.

There is quite a lot of conjecture in this post, but I agree with many of the conclusions, and it’s an interesting topic to delve into in order to understand technology adoption in general and Kubernetes in particular.

Tools
=====

Akkeris is a set of components for building a platform as a service atop Kubernetes. It’s currently lacking documentation about how to set things up but might be interesting to some.

Kured solves a useful problem for operators running Kubernetes clusters, namely ensuring nodes are rebooted when needed. It ensures only one rebooting node at once, and will drain connections before rebooting.

EC2 Parameter Store is a useful service for anyone using AWS, and pssh is a handy tool for interacting with it. It provides a file-system-like interface, allowing for moving around and interacting with the parameters in the parameter store.

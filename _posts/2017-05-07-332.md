Lots of talk of multi-cloud and lock-in this week it seemed, although mainly coming from proponents of certain technologies. Some interesting architecture posts as well this week; from event driven serverless architectures to a simpler approach to microservices with SCS.

There are lots of arguments for the various practices often seen with devops. This post makes a strong economic argument focused on learning quickly in small batches.

A solid argument that multi-cloud approaches should probably not be the default for the majority of users when considering either lock-in or disaster recovery.

A similar conclusion to the issue of lock-in for serverless, but with a different rationale. Lock-in is fairly dependent on context in my experience, and more important in some areas and organisations than others which isn’t mentioned here.

Linuxkit was one of the announcements at the recent DockerCon event, and this post demonstrates how to get started building your own Linux-based VM on OS X, running on xhyve.

Some folks have very strong opinions when it comes to continuous integration. This post derives a scoring system you can use as a health check for teams, if you agree with the philosophy around trunk-based development.

A nice example of the power of event driven infrastructure, using CloudWatch as the trigger and Lambda, in this case to create DNS records for autoscaling instances.

An interesting proposal for a slightly different take on microservice architectures, named Self Contained Systems (or SCS). The idea appears to be to sacrifice some tenets of microservices to make deployment simpler.

This post makes the case that there are lots of hello-world Kubernetes examples but few real-world ones, and promptly shows a nice example and then walks through the design decisions.

A good comparison of the pros and cons of structured logging and having applications emit events, and why one doesn’t really replace the other for comprehensive monitoring.

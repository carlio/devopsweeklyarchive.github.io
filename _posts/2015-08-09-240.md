Results from one survey (The Monitoring Survey 2015) and a request to complete another one (Ethical Obligations in Internet Operations) this week. It’s great that individuals in our community help to collect, curate and analyse data that can help all of us improve. Good job everyone involved.

Results from the 2015 monitoring survey are starting to be published, with lots of data and analysis of the current state of tooling and what people are monitoring with them.

A fun presentation I gave this week at the London Web Performance meetup, trying to combat the hype surrounding containers and microservices with some critical thinking around performance.

Makefiles are awesome, I’ve lost count of the the number of times I’d rather be using Make than a programming-language-specific derivative. This site has a nice set of tutorials for understanding the basics.

Learning from failure, and being open about operational issues, has definitely been one of the properties of the devops community I like the most. This detailed downtime postmortem has lots of great details to learn from.

An interesting questionnaire on the ethical obligations in internet operations, collecting information ahead of a talk for Velocity NYC. I’d love to see people fill this out and look forward to featuring the results in October.

Puppet 4 (obligatory disclaimer that I work for Puppet Labs) has been around a little while now and this blog post delves into some of the new features and functionality.

Some good tips for anyone moving to more of a service based architecture having previously used the database for integrating applications.

It’s easy to measure AWS purely on all the new features being shipping but the internal improvements are also impressive. This post features benchmarking of AWS network connectivity, showing a 40% improvement in some areas on the same tests a year ago.

This issue might be a bit heavy on content from Velocity and DockerCon, but luckily both events were excellent and contained lots of great talks. Normal service will resume next week.

Velocity
======

I managed to somehow do a talk at Velocity where I debated myself on the topic of software adoption, focusing on the Google Infrastructure for Everyone Else meme.

We’re all individually and collectively making technical decisions all the time. But are they the right ones? This excellent presentation presents some handy tips for making better decisions.

A tale of running Nagios in production for 10 years. A tale of constant improvement and learning, and the addition and building of tools to improve the operator experience.

This talk covered the importance of design to building an effective security organisation. Lots of good tips and a good reminder that security is a wide ranging multi-disciplinary activity.

Similar to the Nagios talk above, this one covers the evolution of ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana in the same organisation. I like this format.

DockerCon
=========

One of the announcements that got the most interest at DockerCon was the new swarm integration. This post explores the new service model and the built-in load balancer.

I also got to speak at DockerCon, on The Dockerfile explosion and the need for higher level tools. All about scaling image build, with some ideas for the future and a run through various community tools.

A handy set of blog posts with notes from both DockerCon keynotes. The first covers new software or updates to docker. Day 2 focused on partnerships and the ecosystem.

Inspired by the closing demos at DockerCon, this post demonstrates an approach to using docker to provide a function as a service/serverless framework this time in Go.

An opinion about what the integration of swarm into docker engine means for other orchestrators, and the various companies in the space.

News
====

The Pets vs Cattle metaphor is oft-used. This post makes the case that it’s no longer a useful way of talking about our systems, in particular because the reality is a blur of state of converged systems.

If you’ve ever wanted to monitor or tune the linux networking stack then this epic and incredibly detailed post is for you.Fantastically detailed low-level information.

A good post exploring the AWS ElasticSearch service. Interesting to read even if you’re not an ES user as it has a number of good points for anyone designing SaaS interfaces for existing software.

Tools
=====

There's been an explosion of tools recently for bootstrapping a Kubernetes or Docker cluster. Spread is one such tool, but with a few nice looking features around reproducibility.

Entropy is a fault injection system for Docker based systems. Define a policy and point it at your docker endpoints to trigger failures of containers to aid with building resilient systems.

If you already have a reasonable size AWS setup, adopting a tool like CloudFormation can mean a lot of re-work. Bellerophon aims to generate CF templates automatically from existing AWS resources by querying the API.

The Monitoring Survey 2015 closes at the end of this week. If you’ve not already taken it you should definitely head over to [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/monitoringsurvey2015.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/monitoringsurvey2015.) Last years results where worth reading and seeing how things have changed a year later should be interesting.

Nginx is both great software and very popular so this series of posts about monitoring nginx should be of interest to lots of people. A good run through of what is available and how to get at it.

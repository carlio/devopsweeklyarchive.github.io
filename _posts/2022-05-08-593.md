The rise of very public, in-depth, high-profile incident reports in the last few years is definitely of benefit to the art of systems administration. Atlassianâ€™s post is a great example, covering the recent multi-week outage. Plus posts on organisation design, least privilege and some interesting tools for testing and Kubernetes management.

Some thoughts on software architecture, advocating for more local-first experiences, using the cloud mainly for storage, synchronising and burst compute.

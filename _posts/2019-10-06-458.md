News
====

Multi-cloud often gets folks riled up, but in my experience it’s often the result of distributed decisions and pragmatism rather than one-true architecture. This post does a good job of making that argument.

Some hard won tips for optimising an Elasticsearch cluster. Looking at improved defaults in recent versions, sharding, indexing and memory usage.

Serverless architectures change a few things about how we build and run systems, but the basics like caching are still very relevant. This post explains why.

Having a chat interface to ops tools is increasingly common. This post explores building such an integration, with some good tips for UI design for conversational interfaces.

Kubernetes has a concept of liveness probes, that help Kubernetes understand if an application is running as expected. Unfortunately they have some downsides that you should be aware of. This post describes when and how to use them.

Events
======

KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America is coming up in San Diego from the 18th until the 21st of November. The schedule is packed with talks on the CNCF projects like Kubernetes, Envoy and Helm as well as case studies, community meetings and more. The code KCNADOW19 will save DevOps Weekly readers 10% off the ticket price too.

The O'Reilly Velocity Conference heads to Berlin, 4–7 November. Velocity is the best place on the planet for web ops and systems engineering professionals to get expert insight on building and maintaining cloud native systems. With 4 days of practical content on cloud native infrastructure, DevOps, Kubernetes, and more, there's something for everyone. Passes start at €676 when you use the code DEVW20 (applies to Gold, Silver, and Bronze passes). Register today!

Tools
=====

S3audit is a small tool that quickly checks all of your S3 buckets are securely configured, from being encrypted to having ACLs in place.

Wksctl is a new tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. Rather than another point and shoot tool, wksctl aims to make managing many on-demand clusters easier using a control loop and declarative configuration for the cluster itself.

title: DEVOPS WEEKLY ISSUE \#230 - 31st May 2015 
date: 2015-05-31T13:23:20+01:00

A bit of a monitoring/performance/security feel this week - mainly due to Velocity conference this last week and partly as I’m heading to Infosecurity Europe this coming week. Thanks to folks who sent me infrastructure testing links last week too.

Excellent keynote talk from this weeks Velocity conference, all about engineering for the long term. Lots of insightful tips about standardisation and scaling distributed systems and the teams running them.

The concept of legacy has lots of different definitions but this post is a nice reminder that software is often around longer than the language it’s written in is regarded as cool.

Some interesting points about scaling microservices, in particular with regards development environments and traffic routing ideas.

A good discussion, backed by some data, on the security considerations of running third party containers downloaded from the internet. Worth reading both posts.

How are trends like software as a service, cloud computing, containers, etc. affecting traditional IT asset management practices in large organisations?

Security @Scale happened last year but I missed this post which features some excellent videos on securing chatops, running a bounty program and several examples of in-house security tools.

Someone recently asked me for a list of good books to read on information security. I wrote it up as a blog post which a few people might find interesting.

Ignoring the nagios-bashing this is a good post about using consul’s built-in health checking as the foundation of a monitoring system. Includes code samples for sending alerts to a third party alerting system.

Another talk from Velocity, this one about using your monitoring tools to build a performance alerting system, and making those alerts actionable.

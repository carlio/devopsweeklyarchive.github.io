Shipper introduces deployment strategies (like blue/green deployments and canary releases) into the Kubernetes API. Nicely avoids complex CI automation or deployment scripts, and integrates with Helm charts.

Osiris enables greater resource efficiency within a Kubernetes cluster by allowing idling workloads to automatically scale-to-zero and allowing scaled-to-zero workloads to be automatically re-activated on-demand by inbound requests.

ecs-deploy is a continuous deployment platform for AWS ECS. It automates deploys based a simple JSON file which can be integrated in your CI/CD.

With more systems comes more places to store user authentication and authorization information. rbacsync introduces Kubernetes custom resources to avoid this problem, syncing user details from Google accounts to native Kubernetes RBAC.

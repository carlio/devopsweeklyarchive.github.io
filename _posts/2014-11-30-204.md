I had huge fun at the New Directions in Operating Systems conference this week and have included a few related posts and presentations in this issue. Small, super-niche, community conferences like this, Monitorama and Configuration Management Camp feel like great places to learn new things - thanks to all the people who organise them.

If you missed out on New Directions in Operating systems this week this epic post of notes from all of the talks should be of interest. Lots of talk of rump kernels, unikernels, configuration management and more.

My talk at New Directions in Operating Systems, all about the history and possible future of configuration management as both a discipline and an evolving tool set.

One of the common threads at New Directions in Operating Systems was a move towards a different mental model of the operating system. This talk did a good job of articulating some of the reasons why.

Details from a recent survey of the state of monitoring have started to be published, with some interesting results. So far you can have a look at the demographics of respondents, and see what tools people are using today.

Kubernetes is powerful but developing quickly, so keeping up can be a challenge. This post does a good job of explaining all of the main concepts along with examples in one place.

A multi-post tutorial covering building a docker based infrastructure using Puppet, Foreman, Packer and Crane. The details about using the different tools together makes for an interesting read.

Tools
=====

Charted is a way of sharing graphs. I’m a big fan of using monitoring tools for business metrics, but exposing that data can be hard. Charted looks a great bridge to get other people interested in data.
